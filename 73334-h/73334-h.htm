<h2 class="nobreak">PROLOGUE<br>

<small>IN CHEER STREET, LONDON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry Cardinegh</span>, dean of the British word-painters
of war, was just home from China, where he had caught
the Allies in the act of relieving Peking. It had been a
goodly and enticing service, both to watch and to portray,
calling out much of glorious color and tension and peril,
and not enough slaughter to chill the world’s appreciation.
Cardinegh sat by the fire in his little house in Cheer
Street, London, and was ministered to by his daughter,
Noreen, a heavenly dispensation which the old campaigner
believed he had earned. A dinner together, just
the two, truly a feast after lean months crossing the
mountains of separation. Then whiskey, glasses, soda,
pipes, tobacco, papers of the afternoon—all served by
the dearest of hands. The gray, hard veteran lived,
indeed, the maiden filling his eyes.</p>

<p>Twenty he had left her, and she was twenty still,
but the added fraction of an inch made her look very
tall, and startled him. There was a mysterious bloom
under the luminous pallor of her skin; fathoms more
added to the depth of her eyes, and a suggestion of
volume to her voice. Nature and heritage had retouched
the girlish lips in color and curve, widened the tender
Irish eyes, added glow and amplitude to the red-gold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
hair.... There had only been two women in the
world for Jerry Cardinegh, and the other was a memory—the
mother.</p>

<p>“And who do you suppose is coming to-night,
deere?” he asked. There was a silver lining of the
Tyrone tongue to all that Jerry said, but it was so subtle
and elusive as wholly to defy English letters, save possibly
that one word “deere” which he rolled fondly for
Noreen, and here and there in the structure of a sentence.</p>

<p>“Some of your war-men to relieve Peking again
to-night? Who, father?”</p>

<p>“Just one. The best and weirdest of them all. He’s
on the way home to the States. You met him in Tokyo
five years since—after the Japanese had whipped China,
and the Triple Alliance had stepped in to gobble the
trophies.”</p>

<p>The girl stirred the fire in the grate thoughtfully for
an instant, then started up in a glad, impatient way.
“Routledge-san?”</p>

<p>“The same. Now, that’s queer—after five years—I
mean, the Japanese title of address—‘Routledge-san.’”</p>

<p>“That’s what I used to call him, and I always think
of him so. I think of him a great deal. His work in the
<i>Review</i> makes me. He is one of very few whom I could
welcome gladly—this first home-night with you, father.”
She spoke with the old fearless candor that Cardinegh
loved.</p>

<p>“So you think of Routledge a great deal? And
why, deere?”</p>

<p>“He sees deeply. His work is illuminating to me.
Sometimes I think of him sitting back of his work and
smiling because he knows so much that he dares not set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
down. I think Routledge-san loves Asia—as you, as
we—love Ireland, father.”</p>

<p>“You could not think about a better man, Noreen,”
said Cardinegh. “And so he knows a lot that he doesn’t
write for the <i>Review</i>? Well, maybe so.... He
talks quite as well as he writes—when the spell is on him.
I don’t know a man who can clear a mind of all save
what he’s tossing into it—like Routledge. And the
words seem to twist and work their way deep like
burrs—when he leans forward with an idea.”</p>

<p>Noreen smiled. “And why has he not been back to
London in all these years?”</p>

<p>“You have said it—because he loves Asia.”</p>

<p>“But he has not been back to America?”</p>

<p>“Routledge is quite as much at home in London as in
Philadelphia, his native city. He has worked for the
American press as well as for the English. You see, he
needed us because England has something doing more
or less all the time in the field. In fact, since Japan
took the Chinese Port Arthur in ’94, there has been
plenty for one man to do in following American and
British arms—Cuba, South Africa, the Philippine Archipelago,
and now China again. But I have met him off
and on around the world. They are good men of our
tribe, Noreen, strong, brave, and wise men, but Routledge,
of them all, has warped his craft deepest into my
slip, so to speak. I love the lad.”</p>

<p>She was moving about among the shadows of the
sitting-room—a touch of her hand here and there, unconscious
preparation, probably, for the guest, and a queer
tension in her eyes. It was nine, and a gusty winter
night, when Cardinegh admitted the world-wanderer and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
took his great frieze coat. Noreen watched from the
far end of the hall. Routledge spoke low and laughingly,
and caught the elder man by the hand and shoulder. A
sense of exhilaration in full sweep dilated the veins of the
girl, and with it, too, was a certain chill of dread, some
nameless portent—a blend of joy, and its price in pain,
all in that first glimpse. It was like the prelude of a
song, or the prologue of a story, which contains an
element of each emotion in the appeal of the whole....</p>

<p>“And this is Noreen—the little Noreen whom I once
dared to call my Japanese sweetheart. Why, it’s water
out of the rock to see you again, Miss Noreen!...
Jerry, the years have been consummate artists here in
Cheer Street while we’ve been away growing old.”</p>

<p>Noreen heard herself saying, “I have felt close to
you a great many times, Routledge-san,—all wrapped
up, as in a blanket, in those fat <i>Review</i> columns under
your name.”</p>

<p>“’Tis true,” said Cardinegh. “We’re all flawful
imitations beside you, son.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking how good, how ripping good,
‘Routledge-san’ sounds again,” the guest declared.
“It’s like a song of home heard from a passing ship.”</p>

<p>Before the fire, the two correspondents unshipped
once more under the guns of the Taku forts, for the
listening girl, and followed the Pei-ho, that roiled drain
of a bitter land, up to the Tientsin wall.</p>

<p>“Routledge deserted us that day—went back to his
own countrymen—the American column,” said the father.</p>

<p>Jerry wanted the story told for Noreen, and his
memories challenged and animated Routledge. “Yes,
I wanted to see my boys again,” he acknowledged. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
had one good look at them in Cuba, under Lawton,
who was killed a year or so later, under my eyes, on
the banks of the Maraquina River in Luzon. The Philippines
was a rapid, pretty service, but a service of detachments.
I was eager to see how the boys worked in
numbers. The American troops are nervous, you know,
a little too highly evolved to be atoms. They live for a
higher game in their country—commerce and inventions.
Some time the nation will rise even to a better growth
than that—I mean, to the spiritual evolution.</p>

<p>“The boys were mostly ill in China, thin-blooded from
the tropical Philippines. The column was full of fever,
coughing and cursing a little. They shook in the chill
damps of the nights up Tientsin way.... Poor
chaps, but it was good to hear them talk, before the gray
old walls of Tientsin—that night when the world was
hanging to the cable-ends for the flash, ‘battle.’ I rode
along the huddled column and heard Texas, Indiana, Nob
Hill and the Bronx, Halsted Street and Back Bay—all
from the shadows on the ground, that breathed tired
oaths and shivered in the drive of the fine, chilled rain.”</p>

<p>Jerry took up the picture excitedly: “Do you remember
when the spray of sparks shook out from behind the
wall?—the party in charge of the fireworks was trying
the night to see if it were dark enough. Then followed
a succession of booming crashes. It was as if the
plain was drawn tight as a drum-head, and they dropped
comets on it.... The Chinos got the Russian
range about that time, and left open sores in the snaky
Slav line. And I want to know, Routledge, did you hear
the high-pitched scream from the Japanese when they
snatched the glory of the lead?... Ah, we’ll hear
from those brown dwarfs again!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“I think so,” said Routledge. “They ran forward
like hounds, snapped at each other and gave tongue like
a pack closing in for the kill. Yes, I remember, and then
the fire broke out behind the wall in the native city, and
the sky took on the red—the red of an Indian blanket!
It shone red on the faces of the boys from the States....
Miss Noreen, you listen large-eyed as Desdemona.”</p>

<p>“Tell me more about your boys,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“The trumpet screeched ‘forward,’ and the column
quickened into life,” Routledge explained, “sprang like
magic into formation and swept past, panting, laughing,
shouting in the rain. God, pity them! They were good
boys—good boys, all. I wish they had all come back
with their dreams all turned true.... They didn’t
know what was ahead, except they had seen the blind
gray stones of the wall through the dusk at the end of
the day’s march. They didn’t know what the fight was
about, but they ran to break the wall, gladly, against the
rock of centuries—into fire and steel and the yellow hate
from all the hells. It meant nothing to them after the
wall was broken. That’s the queer, ugly part of it.
The man in the ranks always gets the worst end—and
so pitifully often doesn’t even have a sentiment to enthuse
over. He’s apt to fall in a fight against as good
friends as he has anywhere on this spinning planet, and
what meaning has the change of national boundaries
to his mother?” Routledge was thoughtful for a
moment....</p>

<p>“It seems hard to use grown-ups like that—men,
white men, with spines at right-angles from the snake’s,
and a touch of eternity in their insides somewhere. Poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
devils, getting the worst of it—that’s always the way!...
I watched the tail of the column swaying by—watched
the last fragments blotted up in the rain and
the night. Already, in a red mist on the Tientsin Wall
the dance of death had begun.”</p>

<p>Noreen’s eyes were filled with mysteries and mistiness.
As in his work, Routledge now suggested to her
volumes unsaid. Her heart sensed the great wealth of
the man. She felt an inner expansion. Pity was almost
a passion in his face; and there was hate, too—hate for
the manipulations of the rulers of the earth, which drove
forward that poor column cursing and coughing in the
rain. She saw it all—as if she had been at his side that
night—the fire-lit field running with the reddest blood
of earth. And across the world she seemed to see the
faces of the maids and mothers of these boys—faces
straining toward them, all white with tragedy. And
more, she seemed to see for an instant the Face of the
high God, averted from His images, because they were
obsessed in that profane hour by the insane devils of
war.... The profile of Routledge fascinated her.
He had spoken lightly—as he was accustomed to speak
before men to whom war was a career—but the aroused
girl saw in his eyes, tightly drawn against the lamp-light,
a mystic’s rebellion against the inhumanity of
material power. About his eyes and graven entire upon
the tropically embrowned face was a look impossible to
the men her life had known.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“I was tangled up in a reserve of Russian infantry
afterward,” Routledge concluded. “Jerry, you’ve heard
the Russians sing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“Aye, at Plevna and before, son.”</p>

<p>“It’s a thing worth living long to hear—wild and
mournful as a Siberian winter.... This reserve
roared its song as it bored into Tientsin—a song of
snow-bound hills and ice-bound hearts—poor <i>muzhiks</i>!
And a British battery, tons of charging steel and brass,
thundered the bass!”</p>

<p>So between them, the two correspondents covered
the story of that one fight in the night—on the way to
lift the lid from the legations at Peking. A messenger
from the <i>Witness</i> office at this point brought certain
cable copies for Cardinegh to comment upon for an
editorial paragraph or two. He went into his study.</p>

<p>“Routledge-san, do you mind if I ask you to talk
more?”</p>

<p>Noreen edged her chair closer like a little girl anticipating
a story.</p>

<p>“Such listening as yours,” he laughed, “would make
a Napoleon disclose his plans for the next morning’s
battle. It would bring out the best of any man’s
tales. Ask me anything that I know and it is yours.”</p>

<p>“Always when the other correspondents come
here to Cheer Street—and nearly all of them call to see
father—I have made them all tell me about the bravest
deed—the bravest man—they have ever seen or known in
all their services. I think I know them all but yours.”</p>

<p>“And what do you think my bravest man will be
like, you collector of heroisms?”</p>

<p>“That’s just the point, Routledge-san. I think yours
won’t be a man of merely brute courage. That’s why
I am so anxious to hear.”</p>

<p>“In this case I am like one of the messengers to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
Job—I alone remain to tell you. I have never told any
one, but sometimes it occurs to me to write the story of
Rawder for the few who care to understand. He is my
property, Miss Noreen, a humble martyr with a mighty
soul like Saint Paul’s.</p>

<p>“He is a man born to suffer, as all the great are,
who crucify themselves in various ways to lessen the
sufferings of commoner men. I have never felt the same
about any other man. There is something quite miraculous
about our relation. Accidentally, as it appears, I
have met him somewhere every second year for a double
decade—the last time in Hong Kong this trip home. I
surely shall see him again? Does it sound foolish to you—this
idea of being destined to meet a certain some one
from time to time somewhere—until the End?”</p>

<p>“No. I want to hear it all, just as it comes to you,
with all your thoughts about it—please. Father will be
busy for a half-hour in his study. I think I shall
understand.”</p>

<p>Routledge leaned back with a cigarette, which with
him was only an occasional indulgence. “As I say, I
meet him every second year in my wanderings, and I
am always healed from the jangle of the world and
world-politics after a day with Rawder,” he resumed,
watching her. “He had a strangely unattractive face
as a boy—slow with that dullness which sometimes goes
with the deaf, and a moist, diffused pallor that suggests
epilepsy. His original home was away up in a New
England village, restricted as a mortise-box in its thought
and heart. The Rawders were a large, brief family—six
or seven children—the whole in harrowing poverty.
Certain of the littler ones were hare-lipped; all were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
fright of other children. I never liked New England....
I can see yet the gray, unpainted house of the
Rawders, high on a barren hill against the gray, bitter
sky—rags in the broken window-panes; voices in the
house that you could not forget, yet loathed to remember....
All died in a year except this boy who
became my friend. All met the Reaper without pomp or
heraldry, the funerals overlapping, so that the village
was dazed, and the name of Rawder stands to-day for
Old Mortality at his worst. So there was left only this
one, a strange, wordless type of Failure in the eyes of
the village.</p>

<p>“He was a little older than I—but a sort of slave of
mine. I see it now. I had everything that good family
and parental wisdom could bless a boy with, and he had
nothing. That I pitied him seemed to warm his soul
with gratitude. He expected so little and was willing to
give so much. I wish I had understood better then....
He aspired to the ministry, but his ordination
was long denied him. He was second in his class after
years of study in a theological school, earned with incredible
penury, but his trial sermon or something about him
shocked the community. I know now that it was a
wider, gentler piety. About this time I had come in
from my first trip around the world. Unable to get a
church, he asked for a foreign mission, the smallest
mission in the loneliest, most dreadful land. His answer
was a whisper through the assembly of preachers, challenging
his sanity. Forgive them, as he did, Miss
Noreen. I could not have fully understood the features
of his tragedy, but I remember that when I parted from
him that time, there was a vague desolation in my heart.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
I could not forget the deep, troubled eyes nor the heavy
homely face, all scourged with harshness from a babe,
a veritable magnet of evil fortunes.</p>

<p>“Back from England again, I encountered him in
Boston under the banners and torches of the Salvation
Army. He was thinner, deeper-eyed, richer-voiced, and
all animate with love for his race. For the first time I
felt the real spell of the man. It was something in his
eyes, I think—something that you see in the eyes of a
little child that is dying without pain.”</p>

<p>“Visions,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is the word. Some God-touched thing
about the man in the streets of Boston. But I am making
my story long, Miss Noreen. I did not know that I had
all these details. It has become rather an intimate fancy
of mine—this story.”</p>

<p>“Please tell me all. I think it is to be the story of a
great victory.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the years to come will end it so.... Two
years ago, I was riding with Tarrant’s cavalry in southern
Luzon when I discovered Rawder among the troopers.
It was in the midst of a blistering march of twelve hours
from San Pedro Macati to Indang, without a halt for
coffee or bacon. He did not see me, and I could not
get to him until the column broke formation. What he
must have suffered climbing Fool’s Hill as a regular
cavalry recruit! There was a fight in the afternoon, and
the column was badly jumbled. Every fourth man stayed
behind with three horses and his own. The rest advanced,
dismounted, into action. Rawder was with the
fighting force. I caught a glimpse of him during the
early stress of things. There was just as much iron in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
his jaw as in Tarrant’s, whose valor had vibrated across
the Pacific. Even so, I heard a non-commissioned officer
abuse him like a cur—God knows why, unless it was
because Rawder did not shoot to kill. That night when
we entered Indang, I could not find him. He was not in
the formation next morning. Tarrant rode on without
him. Apparently, I was the only one who cared. I
think he was regarded much the same in the cavalry as
he was by the Methodist conference and before the committee
on foreign missions.</p>

<p>“The next week Tarrant’s column struck war—a bit
of real war. I found all that archipelago-service interesting,
hit-and-run campaigning, with all the human
interest of bigger lines. We were caught on a sunken
jungle-trail and fired upon from three sides. Small in
numbers, but that fight was of the sort which makes
the mess-talk of English regiments for decades, and
their flag decorations. I never saw a bit of action at
closer range. It was even shown to me—the peculiar
way men open their mouths when struck about the belt.
I heard souls speak as they passed—strange, befuddled
utterances, from brains and lips running down, but full of
meaning—sayings of great and memorable meaning. I
saw Tarrant stand for thirty seconds under the first
volleys, dismayed in the yellow glare. There is no sight
for a soldier so terrible as a glimpse of havoc in the face
of his chief, but he righted quickly enough. For the
moment the men tried to cover themselves in the soiled
short straws of their religion.</p>

<p>“It was a voice in the jungle that had startled
Tarrant. I tell you the whole story, Miss Noreen,
because of <i>that</i> voice in the jungle. The natives were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
led by a white man, who wore the khaki of an American
soldier. It was this white leadership which had herded
Tarrant’s column for slaughter in that hot sink of the
jungle. The cry of ‘Rawder! Rawder!’ went up from
the American command. Something in the voice troubled
me—just for a second—with the fear that Rawder <i>might</i>
have run mad at the last.... Listen, I think there
is no hate in the world so baleful and destructive as that
aroused by a deserter who leads the enemy against his
own people. And this man led a black force of Malays!...
The natives retired finally, and the white man
with them. An Indiana soldier was dying in the sun
when all was still. I heard him say wearily, ‘Gawd, if
I could only have killed Rawder, hell would have been
a cinch for me!’</p>

<p>“That’s how they hated him that day. The story of
Rawder, the deserter, went around the world. It had
the eternal grip of interest of a scapegoat who turns into
a fire-brand. Manila sent column after column of infantry
into the Indang country and down below to the
Camarines, but the renegade was not to be captured just
yet.</p>

<p>“I continued to ride with Tarrant for awhile after
that. He found action when there was any; moreover, I
felt that the real story of Rawder had not been written.
He was big to me, and I could not believe the voice from
the jungle was his. Tarrant was ordered with his troop
and two others, dismounted, to Minday, a little island
south of Luzon, which Nature has punished in various
ways. I remember the empty, sun-blinded inlet, as our
little transport stirred the sand. Not a <i>banco</i> or <i>casco</i>
came out to meet us. We were in the midst of a people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
who put up no front for peace. There is a Spanish
tradition that each male native of Minday is possessed
of seven devils and the leaders ten.</p>

<p>“‘Best fighting men on the islands—these Mindayans,’
Tarrant told me. ‘The price of life here is to kill
first, to kill all the time, snakes and men.’ That night I
wandered about the deserted port in the Crusoe silence.
At the edge of the town, I was ‘put out’ by the route of
flashing stars—a blow on the head from behind.</p>

<p>“Oddly enough, Miss Noreen, the natives let me
live. In the morning I awoke in a bungalow and discovered
Rawder sitting in the doorway.</p>

<p>“His queerly-cut eyelids were drawn together by the
intensity of light. Outside, the sunlight waved in pure
white flame. It was the vividest time of the day, of the
hottest time of the year, in the fieriest island of the
globe. Minday is insidious. You can breathe and walk
outside, but if you don’t get under cover when your
scalp warns you with its prickling, you will likely be
buried at eventide by the wild dogs of Minday. Or,
possibly, if your vitality is immense, the sun will spare
your life, but fry the contents of your brain-pan, which
is rather worse than losing an arm.</p>

<p>“Rawder did not note that I was awake. He was
exchanging ideas with a young Mindayan whose skin
was the color of the dead wet oak leaves which floor the
woods at home in the spring. It appears that this stained
one had been in Luzon and learned eighteen or twenty
words of English. Through these, and the signs which
clasp the world, Rawder was amassing Mindayan for
the purpose of—administering Methodism to the natives.</p>

<p>“I had been unconscious for many hours. I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
not rise, and my brain seemed to be working on a little
boy’s shift. For ages, it seemed, I watched the hand and
lip converse, too weak to call, to ask why I lived—my
skull filled with sick-room wonderings. Rawder labored
on with the language, calm, gentle, homely unto pain.
He was leaner, stronger, than before; untanned, but the
pasty pallor was gone from his face. Years had outgrown
the heritage of physical disorder. I had always
noted how his thoughts formed, slowly, thoroughly,
without adornment, but each thought straining his limitations
to the roof of his brain. If an action were
involved in any of Rawder’s thoughts, he carried out
that action, as good hounds run—to the death. I saw
now that wonderful look about him, that Heaven-warmed
something which distinguishes a man who has great
work to do in the world. Perhaps I alone could see it.
They say God never sends a great soul among men
without some one to recognize it. It may be that the
honor is mine in the case of Rawder. Stricken as I was,
I could not help noting his endurance of concentration.
This, as you know, is the gift only of mystics. He was
driving the monkey-mind of the Mindayan interpreter
to the beds of torture with it.... He saw, at last,
that my eyes were open, and came to me, kneeling down
to take my hand. The native seized the moment to
escape.</p>

<p>“It transpired I was in the real village, two miles
back from the port. The Mindayans had brought me
with several American soldiers who had wandered the
night before over the edge of camp, to furnish a bright
torture-entertainment in the town-plaza. Rawder had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
saved my life, but the others had gone out in unmentionable
ways.</p>

<p>“‘I was awake when they brought you in,’ he said.
‘These people have not rallied to me very strongly yet,
or I could have saved the boys who were captured....
But you—I begged for your life through the interpreter,
saying that you were a great teacher and not a soldier,
showing them the difference in your garments—and your
face.’</p>

<p>“Perhaps you can picture, Miss Noreen, his struggle
with the natives, while I had lain unconscious that
night.... I explained to him that Tarrant’s command
took him for a deserter and a renegade, whose
leadership had made fiends of the Tagals. He stared out
in the open for a long time without speaking. He was
not whipped nor enraged, as a lesser man would be. I
think I shall always remember his words:</p>

<p>“‘I seem to fail so many times and in so many ways
before getting started in my real work, Mr. Routledge.
The soldiers are not to blame. They could not understand
me; and yet my purpose was so simple. I should
not have told them that I meant to be a missionary in
Asia when my enlistment was through. It confused
them. Some time all will understand. Some time I
shall do well and not fail.’</p>

<p>“‘But how did you get away from the command?’
I asked.</p>

<p>“‘I do not know,’ he answered. ‘During the fight
I fell from the heat and a slight wound. I awoke alone,
concealed my arms in the jungle, and tried to follow
the troop. I must have mistaken the trail, because I
never saw the American outfit again. Three days of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
night travel brought me close to the big native coast
town of Triacnakato, where I fell in with a party of
Mindayans, there on a trading voyage——’</p>

<p>“‘Tell me, Rawder,’ I interrupted, ‘why you joined
the cavalry in the first place.’</p>

<p>“‘Asia called to me. Always, in those last days in
Boston I heard Asia call me to work. I had no money to
reach the Pacific nor to cross it, so I was enlisted with a
regiment ordered to service here. I had heard of certain
soldiers doing good work among their fellows in the old
English regiments, and thought that until I was free
again I might be a help in the troop. White men do not
seem to listen to me, Mr. Routledge.’</p>

<p>“Thus he talked, Miss Noreen. Do you like him a
little bit—my great man, Rawder?”</p>

<p>The girl regarded him hesitatingly for a moment, as
if to reply was not easy. “I like him so well,” she
answered at last, “that I wish it were my destiny to meet
him every little while up the years, as you do. Tell
me all.”</p>

<p>“And so he had started in to teach the words of
John Wesley, and others, to these Mindayans whom
Spain had left to themselves on account of their ferocity.
God knows why the Mindayans gave him a Messiah’s
chance to learn their language and explain his message,
but they let him live. And now I must tell you about
another moment or two of battle. There has been far
too much war already for your frightened eyes, but this
is short and about my bravest man.</p>

<p>“As we talked, there was a sharp crack of a Krag
carbine. I could not rise, but crawled to the doorway.
The Mindayans had formed in the plaza for action.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Tarrant was coming with his squadron of cavalry to
settle for the murders of the night before, and the naked
Mindayans essayed to meet him in the open—as the
Tagals of Luzon had never dared to do. It was all on
in a moment. Out of the jungle came the boys from the
States—queer, quick lines, blowing their bubbles of white
smoke, dropping down to fire and running forward in
skirmish, answering the trumpet-talk as running metal
answers to the grooves of a mold. In the blazing open—in
a light so intense that it was pain to look through it—the
forces met. Mindayans, with guns dating from
Magellan; the Americans with their swift, animate
Krags; a squadron of white men, three skeleton troops
picked from forty States, stacked against a thousand-odd
glistening blacks all enthused to die. Hell’s forbidden
chambers were emptied that hour, Miss Noreen. I hated
war then—but have hated it since far more.</p>

<p>“They met—before my eyes they met—and the dead
flew out of the lines like chaff, and were trampled like
chaff by the toilers. Hand-to-hand at last; shiny black
of flesh against the dull green-brown of khaki; the
jungle alive with reserves exchanging poisoned salads
of metal; science against primal lust; seasoned courage
against fanaticism; yellow sky above, yellow sand
beneath; blood-letting between, and the eternal jungle on
every hand. It was a battle to haunt and debase a
watcher’s brain.</p>

<p>“I did not know Tarrant’s prowess until that day.
One man might falter in his command, but the lines
were rigid as steel. His trumpeter interpreted every
movement of the commander’s lips. I pawed the
matting of the hut, but could not lift the anchorage of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
my hips. Rawder stood above me, watching, the lines
of his sweating face weaving with sorrow. The thing
was growing upon me—what the end of the fight would
mean to him—but his sad face was clean of all fear.
Years ago, when I was a boy and loved physical courage,
I should have worshipped that clean look of his. Tears
in his eyes for the men who had brutalized him!...</p>

<p>“There is always a last minute to a fight, Miss
Noreen,—when each force puts forth its final flicker of
courage, and the lesser zeal is killed. The last drain of
gameness wins the battle, when strength and strategy
are gone. It wins for spiders and boys and armies.
Tarrant had it.... When it was all over, the men
of Rawder’s troop saw him in the doorway and rushed
forward.</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Routledge,’ he said softly, ‘they are coming
for me. The boys have spoiled my mission here.’</p>

<p>“His hand touched my forehead. The ghastly illness
left me.... I don’t believe in telling a lady a
story which one would refrain from telling his fellow
war-scribes, Miss Noreen, but believe me, you have
impelled it with perfect listening——”</p>

<p>“His hand touched your forehead,” she repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes, and there was something about the touch that
a dealer in war-stuff could not very well enlarge upon
in print. At one moment I was but the shell of a man—and
the next I could rise.</p>

<p>“Rawder’s old troop was running forward to finish
him—Tarrant in the lead. I tried to make them hear—these
white men, as they rushed in, full of the hang-over
hell of a fight. But they would not hear me. The men
saw only the crown of a great day—to kill the deserter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
who had led the Tagals against them in Luzon—Rawder,
the renegade, whom they believed stood also behind the
deaths of last night and this day. To kill him after
whipping the Mindayans would call down the glory of
the Pantheon.... Rawder stepped back, smiling,
empty of hand. I managed to trip Tarrant and yell the
story in his ears as he fell. A top-sergeant went by me
with a native-knife.... The fluids were running
from the man who had saved me, before Tarrant or I
could intervene, but the rest were stopped.</p>

<p>“Hours afterward, in the night, he regained consciousness.
At least, consciousness wavered in his eyes,
and I bent to hear, ‘I am not yet to die.’...</p>

<p>“And it was true, Miss Noreen, in spite of a fearful
wound—but that is all healed.... Tarrant was
relieved from Minday. Back in Manila, we learned that
the real renegade of lower Luzon had been captured
alive by volunteer infantry. His name is Devlin, and he
is since notorious in Luzon story. Through Tarrant,
whom I saturated with the substance of Rawder’s character,
my bravest man was discharged for disability....
A month ago, I left him on the Hong Kong
water-front. He had found night-work among the
sailors—saving them from the human vultures who prey
upon poor Jack-ashore-with-money-in-his-pocket—hard,
evil-judged work, but the only kind that Rawder knows
so far. Many a drugged or drunken sailor has awakened
on board his own ship with a tithe of his earnings and
a whole skin left, to wonder vaguely in after voyages
who was his strange-voiced, gentle-handed protector—the
last he remembered in Hong Kong.... Rawder
told me I should find him in India next—said that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
called to the heart of India by a dream. He is to find his
teacher.... Is it beyond belief to you, Miss
Noreen, that there is a great meaning in this Indian
shadow which has fallen upon my bravest man? I have
known Hindus who could look beyond the flesh of men—despised
by their own race—and discover souls of
stirring evolution and inspiring purity.”</p>

<p>Jerry Cardinegh entered. Noreen caught her breath
quickly, as if suddenly awakened from a dream.</p>

<p>“I feel that some time I shall see your bravest man,
Routledge-san,” she whispered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FIRST CHAPTER<br>

<small>MOTHER INDIA IS SAID TO BE QUIVERING WITH
HATRED FOR HER WHITE CHILD, THE
BRITISH FOUNDLING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dusk was stretching out over the windy hills.
There had been a skirmish that day in upper India. Two
British columns which had campaigned for months apart
telescoped with frightful sounds of gladness. Her
Majesty’s foot-soldiers, already tightly knotted about
their supper-fires, hooted the cavalrymen who were still
struggling with halter-shanks, picket-lines, and mounts
that pounded the turf and nickered sky-high for the
feed-wagons to come in. Every puff of wind bore a
new smell—coffee, camels, leather, gun-reek, cigarettes,
saddle-blankets, and nameless others. To-morrow there
would be a mile square of hill-pasture so tainted by man
and beast that a native-bullock would starve before
cropping there until the season of torrents soaked it
sweet again.</p>

<p>The civilian correspondents grouped together for
mess. There was Bingley of the <i>Thames</i>, respected but
not loved, and rather better known as the “Horse-killer”—a
young man of Napoleonic ambition and
Cowperish gloom. There was Finacune of the <i>Word</i>,
who made a florid romance of war-stuff, garnished his
battle-fields with palms and ancient temples, and would
no more forget his moonlight than the estimate of the
number slain. Finacune made a red-blooded wooer out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
of the British army, and a brown, full-breasted she-devil
out of the enemy. His story of the campaign was a
courtship of these two, and it read like “A Passion in
the Desert,” for which the <i>Word</i> paid him well and loved
him mightily. Finacune had another inimitable peculiarity.
He possessed one of those slight, natty figures which
even civilized clothes cannot spoil; and he could emerge
from thirty days in the field, dapper and sartorially fit
as from a morning’s fox-hunt.</p>

<p>Then there were Feeney and Trollope and Talliaferro,
who carry trays and announce carriages in this narrative,
though high priests of the press and Londoners of mark.</p>

<p>The point of the gathering was old Jerry Cardinegh,
of the <i>Witness</i>, by profession dean of the cult of the
British word-painters of war, but a Tyrone patriot, bone
and brain and passion. Just now, old Jerry was taking a
dry smoke, two ounces of Scotch, commanding his
servants to beat a bull-cheek into tenderloin, and adorning
the part of master of ceremonies. Cardinegh wore easily
a triple fame: first, and always first, for the quality of
his work; second, for having seen more of war (twenty-seven
campaigns since he messed with the Chinese
Gordon, to this night in Bhurpal) than any other man
on the planet; and third for being the father of Noreen
Cardinegh, absolutely the loveliest young woman manifesting
at the present time in London. The old man’s
tenderness of heart for Ireland and for all that Ireland
had done and failed, was known in part among the
scribes and Pharisees. It had been an endless matter of
humor among his compatriots. Just now Finacune
remembered the stock question and launched it:</p>

<p>“Jerry, if England and Ireland went to war, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
would be your home-office—London <i>Witness</i> or Dublin
<i>Contemporary</i>?”</p>

<p>Cardinegh had never answered twice the same.
“Neither,” he declared lightly now, extracting a can of
kippered herring from Finacune’s saddle-bags, “but a
captain’s tent, during such times as I wasn’t leading
the Irish to glory. Have you an opener? I need a relish
to cut this whiskey.”</p>

<p>“The old war-horse isn’t always humorous,” remarked
Bingley, who was sitting apart. Bingley always
sat apart, lest somebody should see his black book of
notes or borrow his provisions.</p>

<p>Trollope turned to Finacune with a whisper. “The
dean is looking ill. Have you noticed?”</p>

<p>Finacune nodded.</p>

<p>“It would be a heller if this little affair in the hills
should prove the old man’s last campaign,” Trollope
drawled softly.</p>

<p>Another figure emerged from the dusk, and Jerry
Cardinegh leaped with a roar into the arms of an agile
giant in a great frieze coat. For a moment it appeared
as if the two were in deadly conflict. Pup-tents were
unpinned, supper-kits scattered, native servants crawled
off as from a duel of man-eaters, and the saintly camels
lifted their heads in fresh dismay. It was a good, a
relishable greeting, and the proper way for men who
love each other to meet after prolonged absence.</p>

<p>“Arise, my children, and <i>kow-tow</i> to Routledge, your
spiritual father!” Cardinegh commanded at last.</p>

<p>All but Bingley obeyed.</p>

<p>“Get up, you young scut,” Jerry called ominously,
“or go feed with the camels.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“I haven’t the honor of knowing the gentleman,”
Bingley said without rising.</p>

<p>“Better read your history some more,” the dean
observed, turning his back upon the young lion of the
<i>Thames</i>. “Gentlemen,” he resumed with an oratorical
pause, “behold the man whom the Gods formed for a
war-correspondent—or a spy, as you like—and they
tempered him in hell’s fire and holy water—the Gods.
Gentlemen, this is Routledge, who knows India better
than any of you know London, and he’s an American.
This is Routledge, who rides alone, who stays afield in
times of peace promoting wars for us—and more wars.
I say, Routledge, when were you home last?”</p>

<p>“Sit down, you ‘damaged archangel,’” Routledge
said laughingly. “I sat before your fireside in Cheer
Street, London, little more than a year ago.”</p>

<p>Hearing the name of the newcomer, the “Horse-killer”
was not slow to gain his feet. He came forward
hastily, the sullenness gone from his face, giving place
to a mixture of envy and admiration. He stared long
and intently at the gaunt profile of Routledge. Finacune
saw the look and interpreted it for his own pleasure in
these words: “And so you are Routledge, the, just now,
so-called greatest of all. Well, I am Bingley of the
<i>Thames</i>. I have surpassed all the others in this campaign,
and some time I shall measure wit and grit with
you. Meanwhile, you are worth cultivating.” And
truly enough the first words of the “Horse-killer” as
he extended his hand were:</p>

<p>“I am Bingley of the <i>Thames</i>, Mr. Routledge.”</p>

<p>“I have both seen and heard of your work, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
admired it, Mr. Bingley,” Routledge responded cordially.
“It is good to know you.”</p>

<p>“And I have heard of you, too,” Bingley replied, to
the delight of the others.</p>

<p>Routledge embraced several old friends, but to most
he was known less in person than by reputation. He had
a tendency to laugh at the Powers in the act of making
war, a tendency to make the world see that war was a
hang-over from the days when men ate their flesh hot
from the kill, not from the fire. Veiled under all his
work, and often expressed openly in a stinging line,
was his conviction that war was a ghastly imposition upon
the men in the ranks. This was considered by the rest
as a mere mental dissipation of a truly great worker.</p>

<p>A certain aloofness added to the mystery and enchantment
of the man. In the field, he would attach himself
to some far-ranging column out for dirty work, choosing
his command from an intimate knowledge of the leader
and the men; to which was added a conception of India,
her topography, strategies, fighters, and her methods of
thought and action which could hardly be paralleled—outside
of the secret service—in any British mind.</p>

<p>The <i>Review</i> invariably kept a second man at the
heart of things to cover the routine, so that Routledge
could follow his inclinations for hard-riding and bring
in his wondrous tales of far chances, night attacks, the
enemy at first hand, the faces and valor of the few who
hearkened to the swish of the Reaper, the scream from
inert flesh as the spirit flees away—the humor, the horror,
the hell of the clash.</p>

<p>It is an axiom of the craft that in a platoon fighting
for its life there is all the grip of human interest that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
appals in the collision of fifty-mile battle-fronts; and
Routledge played the lesser game to the seeds. It was
said of him that he could crawl into the soldier’s brain
and watch the machinery falter in full blast and break
down. Always you felt, as you read him, that he had a
great pity for the ranker, and a great hate for the
system that used him.</p>

<p>Where the Terrible was involved, there was a jolting
energy in the descriptive powers of Routledge. Even
the type which bore his messages from the field to the
streets of London seemed sometimes vivid, crackling
characters snapped hot from the reeking centres of war.
He could make his first lines stand out in the thick
<i>Review</i> columns like a desert sunset.</p>

<p>At the end of a campaign, instead of seeking the
seductions of hero-worshipping London, Routledge
would drift, possibly disguised, into some Indian hot-bed,
there to study language, occultism, Borgian poisons, or
Cleopatran perfumes. Tales of his ways and his work
took the place of his presence at home in times of peace.
Some traveller coming in from afar would relate how
Routledge had smiled through a six-day water-famine;
how Routledge had missed the native knives which find
so often the source of human fountains in the dark. It
was whispered, and accredited, that the Brahmins called
him <i>One</i>; that they remembered him as great and distinguished
and of sacerdotal caste in some former incarnation,
and were loyal still. This is an honor so great
that there are not five score men in all the occident who
adequately can appreciate it. Mother India is sensitive
to the warming currents of a great man, even though he
be a derelict in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>Routledge had made the English-speaking world
utter his name familiarly and to look for the same in
public prints. For this reason, Finacune, with his typewriter
on his lap, an American <i>poncho</i> spread upon the
turf beneath him, his back against a stone, and a lantern
at his elbow, rained a column upon his machine. Finishing
the work with a half-smile, he hooted aloud:</p>

<p>“Oh, Routledge—see what comes o’ riding alone!
In a month or six weeks, God loving the mails, the <i>Word</i>
will publish: ‘The civilian mess was joined to-night by
that young roving planet, Cosmo Routledge, who in
present and former campaigns has driven straight to
the source of exclusive information and pulled the hole
in after him.’ Then, for a stick or two, I have discussed
the great frieze coat,” Finacune added whimsically,
“described the prophet’s brow, the slender hands of
swift eloquence, and the sad, ineffable eyes of Routledge,
born of America, a correspondent for the British, a
citizen of the world, at home in India, and mystic of
the wars.”</p>

<p>“Just add,” Cardinegh remarked meltingly, “that
his heart beats for Ireland.”</p>

<p>That was a marvellous night. Big natures throbbed
in rhythm. Whiskey as it sometimes will—the devil of
it—brought out the brave and true and tender of human
speech. Routledge told a bit of the story of the great
frieze coat.... They were moments of trampling
violence in the narrative; instants of torrid romance—to
which the wearer had been a witness or a listener....</p>

<p>“Ah, they made cloth in those days,” old Jerry sighed.
“Would you look under the collar of it for the name of
the old Belfast maker?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“It’s there, sure enough,” said Routledge, “as Tyrone
is water-marked in the great Cardinegh scroll.”</p>

<p>Jerry did not answer for a moment. His face looked
singularly white in the dark.</p>

<p>“The dean went back to Ireland just before we came
out here this trip,” growled old Feeney, of the <i>Pan-Anglo
News Service</i>. “It seems he couldn’t start an insurrection
there, so he rushed back to the <i>Witness</i> office and
haunted the cable-editor’s room until the Bhurpalese
took pity on him and began shooting at Tommies.”</p>

<p>Hours passed with talk and laughter, liquor and song.
It was strictly a night session of the inner section of
war-painters; and in spirit the high priests of elder
service trooped back to listen among the low-hanging
Indian stars.... It was knee-deep in the morning
hours when Routledge and Cardinegh drew apart at
last. They walked out between the snoring lines,
whispering:</p>

<p>“Jerry, what has this narrow-gauge campaign done
to you? Fever or famine? You look drawn and blown
and bleached.”</p>

<p>“I am going into the lair after this,” Cardinegh said.
“The boys won’t believe it, but this is absolutely my last
fling at the field. I am going home to Noreen, son, and
London and the <i>Witness</i> may go to hell.”</p>

<p>There was unnatural venom in the old man’s words.
His tightened hands stirred restlessly; his eyes, seen
in the flare of a match as he lit a cigarette, were unquiet,
alive with some torture of tension. Routledge gripped
the vehement arm.</p>

<p>“You are oxidizing a bit too much tissue, old war-horse,”
he said quietly. “You’ll want to go into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
meadows for a while when you get back—but you won’t
stay there. This stuff—the smell of it, as now in the
dawn-dew, and the muttering formations presently”—Routledge
waved his arm over the bivouac—“things
like this won’t let you run long in the pasture. When
the war-headings begin to grow on the front pages of
the <i>Witness</i>, and the cloud no bigger than a man’s hand
grows and blackens into a mailed fist gripping a dagger—why,
you’ll be at the lane-fence nickering for harness.”</p>

<p>“Routledge, don’t go over all that rot again,” said
the old man. “It isn’t that I’m out of strength, but I’m
too full of hate to go on. I’ve always hated this smug
English people, and I’m not mellowing with years. I
feel it hotter and hotter—sometimes I feel it like a
running incandescence inside. It leaves my brain charred
and noxious—that’s the way it seems to me....
Yet, I have been one of England’s first aggrandizers. I
have rejoiced in print at her victories. I have cheered
with the low-browed mob, ‘God save the Queen!’ I
have borne the brunt of her wars—<i>the son of my father</i>!”</p>

<p>Routledge was disturbed, but he chuckled softly.
“One would think you were still a fire-brand of the
Fenians, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“I know to whom I am talking,” was whispered
queerly. “The Fenians are not dead yet—not all the
Fenians.”</p>

<p>“When did you hear from Miss Noreen last?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a fortnight. We ought to get mail at
Madirabad.... I must write. My God, I must
write!... Don’t mind me if I ramble a bit, Routledge.
I drank rather plenty to welcome you back.
Whiskey sizzles along my spine rather faster than once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
upon a time.... And you haven’t seen Noreen
for——?”</p>

<p>“For over a year,” Routledge said.</p>

<p>“And you haven’t heard that they call her the most
beautiful woman in London?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jerry. I heard it from General Falconer at
Bombay; from the Sewards in Simla; from Bleakley,
who came back to Hong Kong after a year’s leave with
a made-over liver and a child-wife. But then I knew it,
Jerry—yes, I knew it.”</p>

<p>“But she burst into bloom astonishingly after you
left us. She has never forgotten you, Routledge....
She is like the Irish girl who gave her to me.”</p>

<p>“Come on to bed, Jerry. We drive like carrion-birds
across the world wherever there is blood spilt upon the
ground. We’re not fit for a woman to remember.”</p>

<p>“The woman who gave Noreen to me—could remember
and wait, son!... Ah, God, the red hells I
have passed through!”</p>

<p>Routledge reflected upon the furious emotions which
had stormed his old friend in a ten minutes’ walk. From
the furnaces of British hate, he had swept to the cold
caverns of gloom wherein he had laid the wife of his
youth. Only four months ago he had left Cardinegh
hard, full-blooded, iron-gray. The dawn showed him
now a bent, ashen, darting-eyed old man, of volatile
but uncentered speech. The tragedy of it all was germinating
in the faculties of the younger man. Moreover,
with a thrilling freshness, the night and the return to
old London friends had brought back his own memories....
“She has never forgotten you, Routledge!”...
Nor had <i>he</i> forgotten the pale, exquisite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
face of Noreen, large-eyed with listening under the
lamp in Cheer Street. Her every change of expression
recurred to him; and for each phase of the story he had
related, there had been different ranges of sorrow and
sympathy.</p>

<p>In the queer, sensitive mood, Routledge tried to put
away his memories. Only a God was fit to mate with
this moment’s conception of Noreen Cardinegh, as he
stood with her father in the new day, already defiled
by the sprawled army. He wished that he had not seen
so much of war. Fate had put a volume of battles into
the binding of his brain. In the very centres of his life,
series upon series of the world’s late and horrible tableaux
had been imprinted. Routledge was impressed with the
queer thought that such pictures must dull the delicacy
of a man and sear the surface of his soul, like lava over-running
a vineyard of Italy.</p>

<p>“Will you go home after this little thing is over?”
Jerry asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“Yes, and it won’t be long.”</p>

<p>“You wizard!—what do you mean?” Cardinegh
muttered, with a start.</p>

<p>“I mean the present bubble is just about to be
pricked.”</p>

<p>“I—at least, the boys—supposed this campaign to be
but nicely on!” Cardinegh’s voice was a husky whisper,
and his hand had gripped the sleeve of the other. “Tell
me what you know!”</p>

<p>“Softly, Jerry!” The voice of Routledge was inaudible
two feet from his lips. “It’s all rumor—indefinite,
ungrippable, as if the clouds had whispered it—and yet
there is something big behind it all. Down in Calcutta,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
the seats of the mighty are trembling. British India—take
it from me—is too agitated by some discovery
within, or revelation from without, to bother much
further with a little native rebellion like this. And yet
even this may have its relation to the big trouble. A
native paper has dared to print this sentence—a good
sentence, by the way: ‘Mother India is quivering with
hatred for her white child, the British foundling!’
Would a Hindu journalist dare to print that without
real or fancied backing? ‘Unauthoritative, but important
if true,’ as the <i>Review</i> says, is my own idea. It is
this: Russian spies have insinuated themselves somewhere
into the arcanum of British India; the Bear has
lumbered off with information that is already pulling the
English forces into defense—from bigger game than the
Bhurpalese. If Russia is arming the Border States and
has secured information of the fire-brand sort against
England—the latter is a good deal like a shorn Samson
just now—throwing so much power in little Bhurpal!...
Something’s askew. There’s a rival in the
north.... It’s all vague, vague, but big—big as Asia!...
Listen to an amateur prophet, old Ironsides:
if we live three years, we’ll see a collision of fifty-mile
battle-fronts!”</p>

<p>They were back in the civilian camp. Cardinegh
did not speak, but his face was mad with excitement,
his hands ungovernable.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SECOND CHAPTER<br>

<small>THE BAFFLING INDIAN MYSTERY IS DISCUSSED
BY FOUR MEN WHO SHOULD HAVE
BEEN FIRST TO SOLVE IT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Powers are held together with links not welded
by hands. The strain upon the weaker links sets to
quivering the entire cable of civilization. Certain sections
of the system grind constantly against each other,
and inevitably there comes a period when snapping is
imminent. At such a time the two material forces draw
apart for defense. Frequently peace is preserved by
silent affronts of power; frequently by an easing of
tension on either hand, a more comfortable adjustment
of boundaries, and thick applications of the lubricant,
diplomacy. The time is critical, however, and in either
background the engines of war are assembled against
the crisis.</p>

<p>Something had happened in India. It was retching
for outlet at Calcutta, seething through Indian provinces.
London and St. Petersburg were jerking with its startling
galvanism. The correspondents afield in Bhurpal
began to sense this mysterious friction, but could get no
word nor line on the truth. Rumors were thick as
<i>confetti</i> in Mardi Gras. Rumors ran through all shades
of dreaming and shapes of reason. One story was that
China had wiped out the foreign concessions from Hong
Kong to Vladivostok and had challenged the world to
war; another that Russian armies were swarming over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
the Himalayas, and that all India stood ready to back
the Russian Bear against the British Lion; that England
would call upon Japan and the United States, and Russia
demand the alliance of the French and Germans; in
short, that there would be a merry manifestation of hell
around the world.</p>

<p>Routledge tarried but one day with the civilian outfit.
He had been gone but forty-eight hours, with Bulwer-Shinn’s
cavalry, when the rousing mystery which he had
intimated to Jerry Cardinegh in their brief night walk,
began to be felt by the army and its followers. That
which was known in the secret councils of Calcutta and
London never reached the field, but the results did.
The campaign came to an abrupt close. The hand behind
history beckoned; and arteries of horse, guns, and infantry,
running like lines of red ink over the map of Bhurpal,
were bottled up into garrisons to <i>wait</i>. The petty insurrection
in the hills, which had called the soldiers and
scribes to action after a bleak stretch of peace, was as
remotely forgotten as the vagaries of a fever past.</p>

<p>One after another the correspondents were recalled—uneasy,
irritable, their work half-done and wholly lustreless.
All their cables of the last days (messages that
hinted some grave international lesion; the strained,
dwarfed results of minds that searched the stars and
the soil for truth) were either stopped in the sending
or answered by a crisp word that nothing more of the
sort was wanted. This was heart-breaking.</p>

<p>Feeney, Finacune, Trollope, and Talliaferro had fore-gathered
on the veranda of the Bengal Hotel in Calcutta.
They were awaiting ship for Madras, Bombay, and
Home. It was ten days after the big social night in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Bhurpal, and early in January, 1902. Trollope had promulgated
a theory. It was a full-rigged, painstakingly-ballasted
theory, involving hours of heavy work in a
smutty, sweltering coach on the way down from Madirabad,
and Trollope was a heavy man who drew heat—“the
Blue Boar,” a few intimates dared to call him.
The theory contained a discriminating opinion, weighed
to a dram, on the cause of the sudden scatter of troops
from field to garrison, and undertook to interpret the
pregnant undertone of disorder which whispered across
the empire. A cablegram from his paper, the <i>Examiner</i>,
had just been delivered, and was spread out upon the
table before the others. Trollope was breathing hard.</p>

<p>“Can’t use theory matter,” the dispatch read. “Campaign
closed issue.”</p>

<p>Trollope looked up presently and found awaiting his
eyes three wide, indulgent smiles. Trollope was so
seldom disconcerted that he now furnished an enjoyable
moment for the others.</p>

<p>“Cheer up, fat boy,” observed Finacune. “Your old
man always was a ruffian. The <i>Word</i> handed me the
same thing when I undertook to explain to the boarding-schools
of London what this reverse was all about, only
the <i>Word</i> did it in a refined, delicate way. You know
I dreamed it all out that Russia had come to pay court to
Mother India, and that there was a hitch about Tommy
Atkins acting the best man——”</p>

<p>“It was the only decent thing I sent in from the
campaign,” Trollope growled.</p>

<p>“They know more about it at Home than we do,” said
Feeney, the saturnine, a confirmed wanderer, next to
Cardinegh in years of service. He had searched the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
world for forty years to watch the crises of human
events.</p>

<p>Finacune inquired with a trace of animation, “We’ve
all four been recalled, haven’t we?”</p>

<p>The others disdained to answer, but Finacune went on
airily. “We are experts—picked men—the choice of
Europe to cover the turmoils of India and elsewhere.
None stand beside us. Is this the truth or not?”</p>

<p>It was acclaimed that this was plucked from the original
garland of truth.</p>

<p>“Now,” the <i>Word</i> man asserted, “we find our cables,
our expert and expensive cables, not cut, not filed for
reference, not even trusted to the janitor’s basket, but,
so far as we know, <i>burned unborn!</i>... We have
received no explanation. We are not even told that we
have done well or ill.”</p>

<p>“I was told to shut up and come home,” drawled
Trollope.</p>

<p>“The same pellet in different coatings is being
absorbed in the systems of three of us present,” Finacune
added. “Listen. I’ve got a theory. England is
menaced by her logical enemy from the North. Some
brilliant <i>coup</i> has been executed by the Russian spies,
or else there has been treachery. I make no pretension of
knowing just what has happened. Any way, it is big
enough to make our native rebellion look like a flicker
in a holocaust. The trouble is so big that it must be kept
from the world, from the English people, from all but
the Engine-room of England! We are muzzled, and
our papers are muzzled. In a word, the crisis is so big
that <i>the Press has rallied around the Throne</i>—to keep
the matter dark!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>There was considerable comment after this. The
atmosphere was charged with earnestness. The belief
grew that the clear-headed little humorist, Finacune, had
pricked the pith of the question. The situation furnished
certain gorgeous playthings for discussion. The idea
that the Czar’s secret service, either through the purchase
of a traitor or some miraculous thievery, had secured
information explosive enough to blow out the British
underpinnings from India, amounted to a huge and awful
conception in the English mind. Even the pale, listless
Talliaferro, the stately <i>Commonwealth’s</i> “Excalibur,”
stirred restlessly.</p>

<p>There was sharp scattering of gravel along the driveway,
and the four turned to see Jerry Cardinegh riding
out on a gray gelding of splendid style and power. He
sped by at a fast rack, bending forward in the saddle,
his white, haggard face in vivid profile against the vine-hung
wall to his right. His gloved left hand held the
bridle-rein with the rigidity of an artificial member.
His shoulders did not seem to fill the coat he wore; his
body looked little and shrunken on the huge beast; his
lips moved.... In the mind of each one of the
four, queerly enough, was lastingly imprinted this flying
glimpse of the well-loved dean as he swung out of the
drive on to the Jasper Road.</p>

<p>“Speaking of wanting to know a thing,” observed
Trollope, “I should like to know what is pulling down
the old man.”</p>

<p>“We’ve all got to break,” said Feeney gloomily.
“Jerry’s breaking the approved way like a good machine
whose parts are of equal tensile strength.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if it is possible,” came from Finacune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
slowly, “for the dean to have a line on the mystery, and
that it is so desperate—you know there are some situations
so desperate—that if one looks them straight in
the face he is never the same afterward.”</p>

<p>“Any international disturbance that could throw old
Jerry Cardinegh off his feet, or off his feed, would have
to concern Ireland,” observed Feeney.</p>

<p>Trollope took up the subject. “It was after that
night that Routledge dropped in upon us in Bhurpal—that
Jerry began really to tear down. They had a talk
together after we turned in.”</p>

<p>“Who should know the real thing—if not that demon
Routledge, who rides alone?” Feeney questioned.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said Trollope, clapping his hands for
a servant, “we sail to-night for Home. By the grace
of the weird god of wars, we’ll be in London, at the
Army and Navy Reception, within a month. Possibly
then we shall be trusted with the secret which our papers
dare not trust to the cable—the secret that is gnawing at
the vitals of who shall say how many Powers? In the
meantime, let us all drink to the man who wrote of
England’s wars—save the deathless Feeney here—when
we were just learning to read fairy-tales—drink to the
man who just rode by!”</p>

<p>“May I add a line, Trollope?” Finacune asked, as
the pegs were brought.</p>

<p>The “Blue Boar” nodded.</p>

<p>“When it comes time,” said Finacune, “for the man
who just rode by to finish his last battle—which we all
lose—may he pass out from the arms of the most beautiful
woman in London—his daughter!”</p>

<p>They drank standing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>Old Feeney broke the silence which followed. They
saw in an instant that he had something big to impart—and
that there was joy in the telling.</p>

<p>“The Pan-Anglo Agency of stripped news which I
have the honor to represent, sent me a little story this
morning,” he declared, with the thin, cold smile which
they all knew.</p>

<p>“Feeney, you dead planet, do you mean to say that
you have got a ray of light left?” Finacune asked. The
two were very hearty friends.</p>

<p>“The Press has rallied about the Throne, as you
say, my emotional young friend,” Feeney went on
blandly, “but the Throne in the interim has turned one
of the smoothest tricks known to diplomacy—all in the
dark, mind you—one of the deepest diplomatic inspirations
ever sprung in the law and gospel of empire-building.
Let us say that some one, by a bit of treachery,
has thrown Afghanistan’s fighting power to the Russians,
lifting it out of the English control. Also let us grant
that Russia, confident of this bulk, is waving the fire-brand
along the whole northern border of British India—plunging
those sullen native states into rebellion—and
telling them why! All lower India, people of the plains,
will respond to the disorder. It has been a case of waiting
for a full century—waiting for the exact moment for
insurrection. India is the prize waiting people. They
build for eternity. In a word, my sweet children of a
battle or two, England faces a great war—with all India
energized by Russia—a ten-to-one shot!”</p>

<p>Feeney sat back and smiled at the vine which had
been the background for Jerry Cardinegh’s passing.
The others squirmed impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“What does England do in a case like this?” old
Feeney requested at length.... “O glorious England—O
my England of wisdom and inspiration! Does
England say, ‘Let us fight Russia if we must’?...
No, my fellow-sufferers; England looks at the map of
the world. The heads of her various top-departments in
London draw together. I mean her Home, Colonial,
and Foreign offices. One of those mute inglorious Gladstones
finds an old petition that has been laughed at and
thrust aside for months. It is from Japan. It is read
and re-read aloud. The unsung Gladstone of the outfit
makes a sizzling suggestion. Japan has asked for an
Anglo-Japanese alliance. With a turn of a pen it is
done. What does this mean, my brothers?”</p>

<p>The thoughtful Talliaferro deigned to speak: “Japan
committed <i>harakiri</i>—that is, many of the young, impulsive
flowers of the army and navy did—seven years ago,
when Russia led the Triple Alliance and looted the
trophies, including Port Arthur, from Japan’s victory
over China. With England’s moral support in an alliance,
Japan will start a war with Russia to get her
trophies back. I’ve got an idea that Japan thinks she
can whip Russia.”</p>

<p>Talliaferro talked so seldom that he was well listened
to.</p>

<p>The ancient Feeney clapped his hands. “If you had
the nerve to follow troops in action, that you have in
world-politics, Talliaferro, you’d have us all whipped,”
he said. “You’ve got it exactly. The insulation has long
been worn off between Russia and Japan, specifically
between Korea and Manchuria. Japan, looted of her
spoils from the Chinese war, is one vast serpent’s tooth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
for Russia. With England’s moral support—I say <i>moral</i>
support—Japan will tackle Russia and sing anthems for
the chance.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that such an alliance is signed?”
Finacune asked excitedly, and Trollope was leaning forward.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Feeney quietly. “The Pan-Anglo
wired me the story to-day, and the <i>Pioneer</i> here will
print it to-morrow morning. Japan will now make
demands of Russia that will force a war. That will pull
Russia up from England’s India borders. Some diplomacy,
that alliance, my boys! England has jockeyed
Russia out of her aggression; rendered helpless the idea
of rebellion in India because Russian support is needed
there; England has put half of Asia between her boundaries
and the possibility of war! The absolute splendor
of the whole matter is that England calls her unheard-of
alliance with Japan—a movement for the preservation
of Chinese and Korean integrity! I ask you in all truth
and soberness—as Saint Paul said—isn’t this humor for
the high and lonely gods?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THIRD CHAPTER<br>

<small>ROUTLEDGE RELATES HOW A MASTER CAME DOWN
FROM THE GOODLY MOUNTAINS TO FIND
HIS <i>CHELA</i> IN THE BURNING PLAINS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Routledge</span> parted from Bulwer-Shinn’s cavalry at
Madirabad and reached Calcutta two days before the
others, except Bingley, who was but a couple of hours
behind him—just enough for the latter to miss the boat
Routledge had taken to Bombay. The “Horse-killer”
took himself mighty seriously in this just-miss matter,
and was stirred core-deep. He wanted to have the first
word in London as well as the last word in India. He
had studied the matter of the mystery with his peculiar
zeal, cabling his point of view in full. So rapidly had
he moved down, however, that he missed a cable from
the <i>Thames</i>, hushing further theories. It was with rage
that he determined to railroad across India and regain the
lost time, possibly catch a ship ahead of Routledge at
Bombay. This was the man he feared at home and afield,
in work and play.</p>

<p>Bingley must not be misunderstood. He was a very
important war-man, a mental and physical athlete,
afraid of few things—least of all, work. Such men are
interesting, sometimes dangerous. Bingley was honest in
material things; on occasion, hatefully so. He was the
least loved of the English war-correspondents, and one
of the most famous. He envied the genial love which the
name of Routledge so generally inspired; envied the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
triumphs of the “mystic,” as Finacune had called him;
copied the Routledge-method of riding frequently alone,
but found it hopeless to do so and preserve the regard of
his contemporaries. The careless manner with which
Routledge achieved high results was altogether beyond
Bingley, as well as the capacity of seeming to forget the
big things he had done. It was necessary for Bingley
to be visibly triumphant over his <i>coups</i>; indeed, penetratingly
so. This failure of manner, and a certain
genius for finding his level on the unpopular side of a
question, challenged the dislike of his kind.</p>

<p>Routledge settled himself for the long voyage with
much to think about and Carlyle’s “French Revolution”—already
read on many seas. Ordinarily, a mystery
such as he had left in India would have furnished material
for deep contemplation, but he chose to put it away from
him and to live in full the delights of a returning exile.
Bombay was agog with the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, but
Routledge did not give the subject more than one of
his days out of the last Indian port. He missed nothing
of the significance of this great move by England, which
had so entranced Feeney, but when he undertook to
delve for the first cause his faculties became lame and
tired, and he had learned too well the therapeutics of sea-travel
to continue an aimless grind. An accomplished
traveller, he put aside all wastes of hurry and anxiety
and allowed his days and nights to roll together without
the slightest wear. Consequently, big volumes of tissue
were renovated and rebound. With Routledge, it was
not “To-morrow we will be at Port Said,” but a possible
reflection to-day that “we are somewhere in the Red
Sea.” Frequently, he read entire nights away; or dozed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
from midnight until dawn, wrapped in a rug on deck.
His brain fell into a dreamy state of unproductiveness,
until he could scarcely recall that it had ever been a
rather imperious ruler of crises; a producer of piled
words which developed, in war’s own pigments, the
countless garish and ghastly films which his eye had
caught. The month at sea smoothed the hard lines of
service from his face, as it softened the calluses of his
bridle-hand.</p>

<p>It was not until the dusk, when his boat steamed into
the shipping before Marseilles, that the old click-click
of his mental tension was resumed and the thought-lights
burned strong again. He found then that much which
had been vague and unreckonable at Calcutta was cleared
and finished, as often so pleasantly happens after a season
of <i>pralaya</i>, as the Hindus express the period of rest,
whether it be sleep or death. Standing well forward on
deck, with the brilliance of the city pricking the dark of
the offing, it was borne to Routledge that his life at this
period had reached a parting of the ways. The divergences
stretched out before him clearly, as if his mind
had arranged them subconsciously, while his material
faculties had drowsed in the lull of far journeying.
Thoughts began to rain upon him.</p>

<p>“Routledge, how are you and the world to hook up
from now on?... You’ve played so far, just
played, scattered your years all over the earth, with but
little profit to yourself or to the world. If you should
die to-night you would possibly have earned five lines in
a thirty-volume encyclopædia: ‘Cosmo Routledge,
American born, an English war-correspondent and traveller,
rode with Tom, stood fire with Dick, and ran with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
Henry; undertook to study at first hand various native
India affairs, and died of a fever at the edge of’—God
knows what yellow desert or turbid river.”</p>

<p>He smiled and lit his pipe, musing on. “The point
is, I’ll be dead long before the fever—if I keep up this
world-tramp—dead to myself and to men—one of the
great unbranded, crossing and recrossing his trail around
and around the world.... Shall I sit down in
London or New York, and double on my whole trail so
far on paper—books, editorials, special articles, long
dinners beginning at eight, an hour of billiards, a desk in
some newspaper office—fat, fatuous, and fixed at fifty?...
Which is better, a gaunt, hungry, storm-bitten
wanderer, with his face forever at the fire-lit window-panes
of civilization, or a creased and cravatted master
of little ceremonies within? A citizen of ordered days
and nights, or an exile with the windy planet forever
roaring in his skull?”</p>

<p>They were warping his ship into dock, and the voices
of France were thick in the night.</p>

<p>“Routledge, you’re evading the issue,” he muttered
after a moment. “It isn’t that you must choose between
one city and the wide world; nor between the desk or the
saddle, a tent of skins or a compartment of brick. You
can ride a camel in London or pack a folding-bed over the
peaks to Llassa; you can be a tramp at home or an
editor afield. It isn’t the world or not, Routledge, but—a
woman or not!”</p>

<p>The flapping awning took up the matter at length.
Routledge relit his pipe dexterously, sensing the very core
of the harbor-breeze with his nostrils, and shutting it off....
He would cross France to-night; and dine in Paris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
to-morrow, breathe the ruffian winds of the Channel
to-morrow night, and breakfast again in London....
His brain had put off the lethargy of Asia, indeed—quickened
already to the tense stroke of Europe. He was
vehemently animate. The rapid French talk on the pier
below stirred him with the great import of massed life—as
it might have stirred a boy from the fields entering
the city of his visions. A few hours and then
London!... “She has never forgotten you,
Routledge.”...</p>

<p>Once he had seen the mother of Noreen—the woman
who, for a little while, was the embodied heaven to Jerry
Cardinegh; heaven in spirit to the old man now. A face
of living pearl; the gilding and bronzing of autumnal
wood-lands in her hair; great still eyes of mystery and
mercy.... In a way not to be analyzed, the sight
of her made Routledge love more Jerry Cardinegh’s
Ireland. Tyrone was hallowed a little in conception—because
it had been <i>her</i> home.</p>

<p>In Paris, at the Seville, the next afternoon, a servant
informed Routledge that a lady was waiting for him in
the Orange Room. There was a lifting in his breast, a
thrilling temperamental response. Some fragrant essence
of home-coming which he had not thought to find in
Paris swept over his senses.... She was sitting in
the mellowed glows and shadows of the Seville’s famous
parlor. The faintest scent of myrrh and sandal; Zuni
potteries like globes of desert sunlight; golden tapestries
from the house of Gobelin; fleeces of gold from Persian
looms; the sheen of an orange full moon through rifted
clouds of satin; spars of gilded daylight through the
billowing laces at the casement; the stillness of Palestine;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
sunlight of centuries woven into every textile fabric—and
the woman, Noreen, rising to meet him, a vivid
classic of light and warmth.</p>

<p>“Routledge-san!”</p>

<p>“To-morrow, I expected to see you—in London,” he
faltered.</p>

<p>“I have been living in Paris. I return to Cheer
Street to-night—to make ready for father to-morrow
afternoon.”</p>

<p>He was burning with excitement at the sight of her,
and the red was deep in her cheeks. It was as if there
had been wonderful psychic communions between them;
and, meeting in the flesh at last, they were abashed,
startled by the phenomenon.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bingley told me that you were to be in Paris
to-day. He left for London last night. I was impatient
to see you. Possibly I did not wait long enough for you
to rest after your journey.”</p>

<p>Routledge did not answer. He was smiling in a
strange, shy way, as few men smile after thirty. Moreover,
he was holding fast to the hand so eagerly offered.</p>

<p>“Do forgive my staring at you,” he said at last.
“I’ve been away a very long time. In India——”</p>

<p>“You may stare, Routledge-san. Men coming home
from the wars may do as they will,” she laughed.</p>

<p>“Finding you here in Paris is immense, Miss Noreen.
I was planning to keep the way open from Bookstalls to
Cheer Street—to ride out with you possibly, watch you
paint things, and have talks——”</p>

<p>“You’ll stay in London for a time, Routledge-san?”</p>

<p>“Yes, until you and Jerry appeal to the <i>Review</i> to
start a war to be rid of me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>She did not need to tell him that she was glad.
“Come, let’s go outside. It’s like an enchanted castle
in here—like living over one of your past lives in all
this yellow stillness.”</p>

<p>She could not have explained what made her say
this. Routledge liked the idea, and put it away to be
tried in the crucible of solitude. “Where did you leave
father?” she asked when they were in the street.</p>

<p>“Away up in Bhurpal—two or three days before we
were all called in.”</p>

<p>He dreaded the next question, but, understanding that
it would trouble him, Noreen pushed into the heart of
the subject without asking.</p>

<p>“Of course, he wouldn’t tell me, but I’m afraid he
isn’t well. I seem to know when ill befalls any one dear
to me.”</p>

<p>“It was a dull, hard-riding campaign, but he weathered
it.”</p>

<p>“I feel him white and time-worn somehow, Routledge-san.
It is his last time afield. He will need me
always now—but we won’t talk of it.”</p>

<p>She led the way through the crowded streets—a cold,
bright February afternoon, with the air cleanly crisp
and much Parisian show and play about them. “I’ll
take you to my studio, if you wish.... It is quiet
and homey there. Most of my things are packed, but
we can have tea.”</p>

<p>“I was planning to leave for London to-night,” he
ventured.</p>

<p>“Of course—we’ll take the same boat. And to-morrow—to-morrow
there will be things for a man to
do in Cheer Street—getting ready for father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>Both laughed. It seemed almost too joyous to
Routledge.</p>

<p>“I can’t endure London—that is, I can’t live there
when father is away,” she said presently. “It seems less
lonely in Paris. London—certain days in London—seem
to reek with pent tragedy. There is so much gray
sorrow there; so much unuttered pain—so many lives
that seem to mean nothing to the gods who give life. I
suppose it is so everywhere, but London conceals it less.”</p>

<p>“Less than India?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but India has her philosophy. There is no
philosophy in the curriculum of the East End....
I wish I could think about India as you do—calmly and
without hate for the British ascendency there. At least,
without showing my hatred. But it seems so scandalous
and grotesque to me for a commercial people to dominate
a spiritual people. What audacity for the English to
suggest to the Hindus the way to conduct life and worship
God! I am Jerry Cardinegh’s girl—when it comes
to India and Ireland. It must be that which makes me
hate London.”</p>

<p>“England is young; India old,” said Routledge.
“Many times the old can learn from the young—how to
live.”</p>

<p>“But not how to die—and yet India has had much
practice in learning how to die at the hands of the
British.... We mustn’t talk about it to-day! The
word <i>famine</i> rouses me into a savage. India famine;
Irish famine; the perennial famine of the London East
End!... Coming home from the wars, you must
not be forced to talk about bitter things. I want to sit
down and listen to you about <i>your</i> India—not the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Cardinegh India. We always see the black visage behind
India, as behind Ireland. You see the enchantment of
Indian inner life—and we the squalor of the doorways.
Yes, I still read the <i>Review</i>.... Ah, Routledge-san,
your interview with the English ‘missionary-and-clubman’
in Lucknow was a delicious conception; yet
back of it all there is something of horror in its humor to
me. Most of all because the ‘missionary-and-clubman,’
as I saw him, under your hand, would have perceived
none of the humor! He would no doubt have called it
a very excellent paper—yet every line contained an insinuation
of his calamitous ignorance and his infant-soul!
I must repeat—what audacity for the cumbering flesh
of a matter-mad people, undertaking to teach <i>visionary</i>
India—how to look for God!”</p>

<p>Routledge invariably became restless when the values
of his own work were discussed before him.</p>

<p>“By the way, Miss Noreen,” he said, “I left Bingley
behind me in Calcutta——”</p>

<p>“He said so, but crossed India by rail and caught a
ship before you at Bombay. Father and the others will
be in London to-morrow. They left ship at Naples to
be in time for the Army and Navy Reception to-morrow
night.”</p>

<p>Routledge was a trifle bewildered as he followed
Noreen up the stairway into the studio, and sat down
by the window. The place was stripped of many things
identified with her individuality, and yet it was all distinctly
a part of her. Trunks and boxes were ready for
the carrier, her portmanteau alone opened. Out of this
she drew the tea-things, and the man watched with
emotion. After the alien silence of the Orange Room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
and the turmoil of the Parisian streets, the studio was
dear with nameless attractions. All the negatives of his
mind, once crowded with pictures of Paris and civilization,
had been sponged clean by India. The moments
now were rushed with new impressions.... The
stamp of fineness was in her dress, and to him a far-flinging
import in all her words. The quick turn of
her head and hand, all her movements, expressed that
nice elastic finish which marks an individual from the
herd. It was even as they had told him in India. Noreen
Cardinegh had put on royalty in becoming a woman.</p>

<p>The man did not cease to be a trifle bewildered. He
was charged again with the same inspiring temperament
which compelled him to tell her the intimate story of
Rawder, and to tell it with all his valor and tenderness.
Impedimenta which the months had brought to his brain
and heart were whipped away now before those same
wondrous, listening eyes. Memories of her had always
been the fairest architecture of his thoughts, but they
were as castles in cloudland, lineaments half-lost, compared
to this moment, with the living glory of Noreen
Cardinegh sweeping into full possession of his life. All
that had been before was dulled and undesirable; even
himself, the man, Routledge, with whom he had lived so
much alone.... In this splendid moment of expansion,
it came to him—the world’s bright answer to his
long quest for the reason of being.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Routledge-san, I have wine and tea and biscuit, and
you may smoke if you like.” She drew up a little
table and chair for herself. “It will be an hour before
the carrier comes for my trunks, and I want you to tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
me if you have seen again—our bravest man. It’s long
over a year since you left him in Hong Kong.”</p>

<p>“Miss Noreen——”</p>

<p>“I’d rather be Noreen to you.”</p>

<p>“Noreen, what is the force of Rawder’s bigness to
you?” Routledge asked, after watching her several
seconds.</p>

<p>“He serves blindly, constantly, among the dregs, and
has mercy for all men but himself!” she said intensely.
“The living spirit of the Christ seems to be in him, and
nothing of sex or earthly desire. I have pictured him,
since you told me the story, as one pure of soul as any of
the prophets or martyrs. I care not for the range of his
brain when he has a human heart like that!... I
wish I could say all he suggests to me, but I mean—I
think he is close to God!”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Routledge. “It is one of the
finest things I know, to have you speak of him as ‘our
bravest man’—to share him with me.... Yes,
I have seen him again, and there is another story to tell,
and I will tell it, as he told me:</p>

<p>“It began with his leaving Hong Kong. He was
never so weary nor so faint-hearted as on one certain
day. It was about the time I was with you for an evening
in Cheer Street. He declares when that night came
he went out on the water-front to his work with a
‘wicked rebellion’ in his heart. A night of rain and
storm. He had rescued a fallen sailor from the Chinese,
and was leading him to his own lodging when he was
struck from behind and trampled. ‘I’m afraid they
meant to kill me,’ he divulged, and added in apology that
the lives of the Chinese are so dark and desperate on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
water-front. His old Minday wound was reopened, and
he awoke to feel that death was very close. You see, the
police had found his body in the rain. He was drifting
off into unconsciousness when a vision appeared.</p>

<p>“He had never touched India at that time in this
life, but it was a bit of India that appeared in his vision,
and it was all very true to him.... Nightfall and
a little village street; an ancient Hindu holy man sitting
in a doorway, head bowed, his lips moving with the
Ineffable Name. Very clearly Rawder saw this and the
rest, so that he would know the place when he saw it
again—the sand, the silence, the river sweeping like a
rusty sickle about the town, and his old master sitting in
the doorway.</p>

<p>“This was the picture that came to him as he lay
in a station of the Hong Kong Sihk-police, and close to
death.... The Hindu holy man, so old that he
seemed to be a companion of Death, looked up sorrowfully
and said: ‘My son, I have come down from
the goodly mountains for you. Just this way, you shall
find me waiting. Make haste to come for me, my <i>chela</i>,
for I am full of years, and already am I weary of these
plains and so many men. There is work for us to do
before we go back together to our goodly mountains.’</p>

<p>“The Sannyasi spoke in Tibetan, which Rawder had
never heard before, but every word he understood as I
have told you. ‘And how swiftly did I heal after that!’
he exclaimed to me, smiling. His pain left him and his
wound closed magically. They told him he would die if
he left his bed, but he finished his healing on the road to
his river and his village. All was made easy for him, as
our bravest man declares. There was a ship in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
harbor, which needed a man to peel vegetables, and
Rawder fitted in, remaining aboard port after port, until
something prompted him to go ashore at Narsapur,
which lies among the mouths of the great Godavari. One
of these he followed up to the main stem, and journeyed,
on foot for months and months, studying the natives and
their language, doing what appeared to him among the
dead and the living in the midst of famine and plague,
and ‘<i>knowing no hunger nor thirst nor pain</i>.’ These are
his words, Noreen.”</p>

<p>“He is like one of those mystics,” the woman said,
“like Suso or St. Francis of Assisi—who would not
reckon with physical pain.”</p>

<p>“Yes.... I did not remain long in America
after leaving you in Cheer Street. In fact, I was back in
India months before this last trouble arose in Bhurpal—with
Rawder in India. It was at Sironcha, where the
Godavari joins the Penganga, that I found him, and he
told me all these things. Then for awhile I journeyed
with him, and it was very good for me. Always he was
helping—down at the very roots of the disorder of things.
I thought of you very much. You were the only one
I had told of Rawder. That’s why I was so glad to hear
you say ‘our bravest man.’”</p>

<p>“And his master?”</p>

<p>“Yes.... It was far north of Sironcha, on the
Penganga, and he had been hurrying, hurrying, for days.
I was to leave him at Ahiri for the service in two days
more. At nightfall, we came to the little village, with
the Penganga sweeping about it like a rusty sickle. ‘It is
the place—I know the place,’ he kept repeating....
Even I was not surprised, Noreen, to see the aged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
Sannyasi sitting in the doorway, his lips moving with the
Ineffable Name.... And so our bravest man found
the master he had earned; the old master who had come
down from his lodge in the goodly mountains to take
back the purest man-soul I have ever known.”</p>

<p>“Then you—then you will never see him again?”
the woman cried.</p>

<p>“That is what is strange to me, Noreen. He said I
should see him again in India this year. He said I would
know the time and the place. They are journeying northward
toward the hills on foot and very slowly. One
might travel around the world, and, returning, find them
only three or four latitudes northward from the place of
parting. And so I left him very happy, learning Tibetan
and Chinese, and the ancient wisdom, happily helping in
the midst of the world’s direst poverty.”</p>

<p>“And you have no thought to return to India so far,
Routledge-san?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>The tea was perfect. The carrier came and took the
trunks and boxes. They sat together in the stripped
studio while the twilight hushed the distances. The street
below lost its look of idling, and the figures moved
quickly.... There were no lights. The man
thrilled in the black hallway as the woman whispered an
<i>adieu</i> to her little Paris place; then shut the door, and,
feeling for his hand, led him to the stairs.</p>

<small>ROUTLEDGE CONTEMPLATES THE PAST, IN THE
MIDST OF A SHADOW FORECAST BY
LARGE EVENTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> dined at the Seville, took a night-train for
Calais, and talked on the steamer’s deck in the Channel.
It was a night of stars and cold gusts of wind. The
lights of France died out behind. A ship appeared ahead
like a faint, low-swinging star, loomed mightily, her
great form pricked in light, and passed swiftly by, so
near that they heard her crushing the seas, and the throb
of her iron heart.... Noreen was saying:</p>

<p>“It’s so good not to have to travel alone. I have been
so much alone. I seem to tell you things quite amazingly....
I must be intensely strange in some way,
possibly psychic, because I dream so many things which
remain vividly afterward.”</p>

<p>The picture she meant to put into words came clearly
with Routledge listening.</p>

<p>“Once, when I was so little that I couldn’t talk plainly—so
little that you might have balanced me in your
hand—a woman came to the tiny room where I lay. It
was in the midst of the night. Father was in Asia somewhere.
I was awake, I think, because I heard the woman
fumbling at the door. She was a big, hysterical thing and
suddenly screamed that my mother was dead—then
rushed away, leaving me alone in the dark!... It
was at a lonely English country-house in winter. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
remember the snow and the winds and the gray, tossing
sky and the nights. I had to stay there alone until father
came home. For more than a month I was in that great
house, with naked, sighing trees all around—trees close
to the walls of the house. They cut the wind into
ribbons and made a constant moaning. And, oh, the
nights were eternal! I was in a broad, cold room in the
great, creaking house—and always I could hear hard-breathing
from somewhere. Alone, I wore out all my
fears there—until at last I had no fears, only dreams of
the night that lived with me all through the day. I have
never gone near that country-place since father came.
How terrible he looked! It left me strange and different—so
that I was never like a little child afterward....
Routledge-san, why do I tell you all these
things? Not in years have I talked so much in one day.”</p>

<p>“Nor have I listened so raptly, Noreen.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have tried to tell you so much—except
that you are to be back in India within a year....
It has come to me, Routledge-san, that you are to go
very quickly!”</p>

<p>There was a creak of a wicker-chair in the shadows
of the engine-room air-shafts behind them. Noreen
grasped his arm impulsively. It was not that she had
said anything which the world might not hear, but her
concentration had been intense, and the little story she
had told had been so intimately personal to her that no
woman, and only this man, had ever called it forth. There
was quick cruelty in the thought of it being overheard
by a stranger. In any case, the spell was broken. Routledge
was irritated. The recall from the world of the
woman, and the feeling of oneness with her which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
strange little confidence had inspired, was pure unpleasantness.</p>

<p>“I’ll go to my state-room now,” she whispered.
“There is only a little while to rest.... Good-night,
Routledge-san. I’ll be abroad early.”</p>

<p>He knew that she would not have thought of her cabin
yet, even though the hour was late, had it not been for
the intrusion of the creaking chair. Routledge took her
hand and spoke a brisk good-night. Returning to the
deck-chair between the air-shafts, he sat down and arose
again carefully. The sound was the same. He tested the
chair thoroughly and found that in no possible way could
the wind have caused the creak.... They had stood
long within eight or nine feet of the chair. A gentleman
would have given some notice that he was within hearing,
or, better still, would have gone his way—unless asleep.
This last was unlikely, because the deck was searched by
a keen winter wind. In the smoking-room was an individual
whose face had become familiar to Routledge since
he had taken the Paris train at Marseilles the night before—a
middle-aged man, strongly featured, wearing a white
mustache. This traveller had also stopped at the Seville.
He glanced up from a game of solitaire as Routledge
entered. There were a bridge-party and one or two
others in the apartment. Routledge chose a cigar very
carefully, and managed to whisper to the attendant in
a light, humorous way:</p>

<p>“Let me look at that cordial-flask a moment, and tell
me how long that man at solitaire has been here.”</p>

<p>The other handed him the package and whispered,
“Just about five minutes.”</p>

<p>Routledge purchased the cordial and passed out. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
happened that he glanced into the smoking-room through
a half-curtained window, and met the eyes of the White
Mustache fully.... It was a little thing—scarcely
a coincidence—for one to cross France by the same stages
in twenty-four hours and break the journey at the same
hotel in Paris. Moreover, because the stranger was not
in the smoking-room fifteen minutes before did not establish
the fact that it was his weight that had made the
chair creak.... Routledge was disinclined to rest.
The day had revolutionized his systems of being. He
longed for daylight again, quite forgetting his usual
patience with the natural passing of hours and events.
The day itself had been unspeakably fine, but there was a
disturbing reaction now and a premonitive shadow that
would not be smoked nor reasoned out of mind.</p>

<p>This, on the night of his perfect day. Noreen
Cardinegh had given him every moment of her time in
Paris, not even saying good-by to her friends....
It was not the mystery in India; not the swift failing of
Jerry Cardinegh, which his daughter felt, though she had
not seen; not the White Mustache nor the creaking chair—these
merely wove into a garment of nettles. The premonition
was not even his own. It was Noreen Cardinegh’s,
and had to do with his leaving her and hurrying
back to India.... “It has come to me, Routledge-san,
that you are to go very quickly!”... The
great frieze coat was wet with Channel mists and
Channel spray when the half-dawn developed the Dover
pier, and the eyes of the wanderer were filled once more
with the seven shades of English gray.... Noreen
was out before the full day.</p>

<p>“Let’s take the earlier train for Charing Cross,” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
said. “I believe we still have time. Our luggage is
checked through, and we can breakfast <i>en route</i>.”</p>

<p>He brought his bag, and Noreen took his arm companionably
as he appeared on the main-deck again....
She was all in gray like the morning, save for
a touch of yellow ruching at her throat and her hair’s
golden wonder-work.... Routledge turned on the
pier at a step behind. It was the White Mustache in light-travelling
order, hastening to make the early train.</p>

<p>A breakfast-table was between them. “Routledge-san,”
she said, leaning toward him critically, “you don’t
look the least bit tired, but I doubt if you’ve slept since
I left you. Beside, your coat is all wet.”</p>

<p>“I did smell the Channel a bit,” he replied, thinking
that a man who looked dull and worn in the presence of
Noreen Cardinegh would be incapable of reflecting light
of any kind. “I couldn’t? feel more fit and keep my self-control.
Though I am not an Englishman, it thrills to
see England again.” He glanced from his plate to her
eyes and then out upon the winter fields, sweeping by
the window like an endless magic carpet. “Some time,
when there are no more wars,” he added, “we shall
write an essay and call it, ‘Grape-fruit and Kentish
Gardens.’”</p>

<p>They separated at Charing Cross, to meet again in
the evening at the Army and Navy reception. Routledge
repaired to his old lodgings in Bookstalls Road and sat
down before his grate-fire in the midst of old trophies
and treasures. Bookstalls was a crowded part of London,
rushing with many small businesses, and convenient to
vast tracts of unbroken undesirability. It was a gorge
that boomed continual clamor. Even at night, when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
protest from the cobble-stones should have sunk to its
stillest, the neighboring fire-department was wont to
burst open at intervals like the door of a cuckoo-clock
and pour forth tons of clangorous polished metal.
Whistles from the far river whipped the smoky air when
the small factories were at peace; night-shifts of workmen
kept the pavements continually animate. There was
an iron-tongued guard in the belfry of Old Timothy’s
Church that never let an hour go by without brutally
hammering it flat, and then bisecting it; and on Sundays
and Saints’ days, the same bell sent a continual crashing
through the gorge with a hurting, tangible vibration, like
a train in a subway.</p>

<p>Bookstalls had been decadent for decades. When
grandfathers were little boys it had been a goodly place
of residence, but small factories had long been smoking
it out. Indeed, it sat in venerable decrepitude by the
fires of its shops. Certain <i>habitués</i> lived on, nor noted
the progress of decay, more than an old rat perceives
the rotting mould sink deeper into his confining walls, or
the crumble of his domestic plasters.</p>

<p>Routledge in London was one of the <i>habitués</i>. The
place was associated to him with dim beginnings—a
store-room of sentiments and war-relics kept by the year.
Before this fire he had written his first views of London
for an American newspaper, and here he had brought
various reminders of travel. To Bookstalls he returned
from his first journey to India—returned with the old
brown Mother’s mystic whisperings in his brain, her
mystic winds filling the sails of his soul. Gazing at this
same grate-fire, tranced as by the heart of crystal, he had
sunk into his first meditations, murmuring the star-reaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
OM—until the boy within him, crude with Europe,
broke the spell in fright, lest his divided bodies join
together no more. Those days he had drunk deep of
the Vedas; and the Bhagavad Gita was one with him
according to his light. Out of these he came to see and
feel the great Wheel of Births and Deaths and Re-Births
moving true and eternal in the cogs of Karma. And,
having once sensed and discovered this, the little problems
of the earth’s day and generation are but gentle
calisthenics for the mind.</p>

<p>Routledge looked back upon those pure days wistfully
now. It is given a man but once in this life to
follow the Way. When manhood is fresh and sensitive,
retaining all its delicate bloom and unhurt power; and
when, full of a hunger that never falls below the diaphragm,
the young man turns for Truth to the masters
and sages—this is the time to choose between the world
and the stars! This is the time that the world gives
battle to detain the searching soul. “Look, yonder is a
Joseph climbing to God!” cries the old Flesh-mother;
and, gathering her minions of enchantment and her
dragons of fear, she scorns the lower cities, all safely
swarming to her tribute, to pluck at the skirts of the
Heaven-called.... What red flowers of passion she
strews before him on the rocky, upland way; what songs
of conquest she summons from the lower groves; with
what romances does she stir his rest, all fragrant-lipped
and splendor-eyed; what a Zion she rears of cloud and
clay to hold his eyes from the Heights—are not all these
written, aye, burned, into the history of Man?</p>

<p>Who goes beyond? A valiant few.... If the
enchantments fail to hold him, and if his clear eyes penetrate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
the illusions of sense; lo, the path grows steep and
dark before him, and there are dragons in the way! The
faith of the youth must be as Daniel’s now, which is
tetanus for lions and palsy for every monster. He has
not lingered with the lusts. Will he not falter before
the fears?</p>

<p>The many tarry in the tinsel gardens of sense; the
few turn back before the roar of the Furies; the One—but
who can tell how the bay-tree blooms for him, where
glory waits?...</p>

<p>The saddest part of all is, that those who are called
and turn back, learn in the coolness of years how treacherous
are the enchantments, and that never a dragon
of the dark harmed a hair of Strongheart; but the way
shines not so clear for a second journey, and the soul
is hardened with skepticisms past responding to the
Inner Voice. The man must be born again.</p>

<p>Routledge sat in his old leathern chair and looked
back a little sorrowfully upon the boy of twelve years
ago, all clean from the dust of the world’s trails, uncalloused
by war, sensitive to the spirit, stirring in the
chrysalis of flesh, all lit with star-stuff!... If only
he had known Noreen Cardinegh then!... He
could look deeply within. He did not love the manner
of man he saw in himself—a wanderer striding over the
East; sitting down often for a year, in the places white
men choose most ardently to avoid, and devoting himself
(who dared look back wistfully now upon those beginnings
of spiritual life) to the reddest ructions of Matter—war,
red war.</p>

<p>He shook his head bitterly, rose, and went to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
window, looking down upon thronging Bookstalls with
unseeing eyes. Out of it all came this at last:</p>

<p>“No, Routledge-san, you have given your reddest
blood and whitest fire to old Mother Asia. Would it
be fair and clean of you to yoke the remnant—and such
an earthy remnant—with the lofty purity of Noreen
Cardinegh?”</p>

<p>Long he stood there in the depths of thinking, until
startled by the softly uttered name:</p>

<p>“Routledge-san.”</p>

<p>He was sure his own lips had not formed the syllables.
He wondered if it had winged across the city from Cheer
Street.... His glance fell to the road. Below, and
a little to the right he perceived the White Mustache.
Routledge seized his hat and descended quickly, but the
stranger was gone. For a half-hour he tried to trap the
other into a meeting, but in vain. It was after mid-day
and raining. He had intended to go to the <i>Review</i>
office, but the old leathern chair and the friendly lodging
lured him back. To-morrow would do for the
<i>Review</i>. To-night, the Army and Navy reception.
Everybody he knew would be there.... She had
asked him to come to Cheer Street, but he could not
bring himself to break in upon old Jerry’s home-coming.
He stirred the fire and fell to musing again in the glow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FIFTH CHAPTER<br>

<small>ROUTLEDGE STEPS OUT SPIRITEDLY IN THE FOG TO
FIND HIS FRIENDS AND ENCOUNTERS
THE HATE OF LONDON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Routledge</span> left his lodgings a little before nine that
night, and breasted the February fog in his great
frieze coat. He was minded to hail a cab when he
wearied of walking, but the time and distance were put
behind with a glow and a gradually quickening pace.
It was a good four miles from Bookstalls to Trafalgar
Square and the Armory where the Army and Navy
reception was held. He skirted Hyde Park, now in the
zenith of its season, and glimpsed Piccadilly again. Its
full electric bloom was a ghastly sheen in the fog.
London, the old and blackened brick Mammoth, was
sweet to him, even now vaporing in her night-sweat....
He had thought of these shops, clubs, lights,
smells, and monuments in the long, heaven-clear Indian
nights. Afar in the Himalayas, where the old Earth-mother
strains hungrily toward the stars (as does the
soul of man who broods in those austere heights), he had
thought hard upon these stirring pavements and yearned
for them in red moments of memory. In the rice-lands
of Rangoon; in the cotton country Bombayward; in the
bazaars of Lahore; overlooking the plains from Simla;
in the under-world of Calcutta, and the house-tops of
Benares—he had mapped these streets in reflection and
colored certain land-marks with desire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>Here, in his own world-yard again, walking for an
hour through the centre of London, and not a human had
hailed him. The strokes of ten boomed down from some
spire lost in the muffling mists.</p>

<p>“One would have to carry a lantern, like the old
prophet of the barrel-house, to find his playmates in a
night like this. Besides,” he added, “most of my playmates
by this time are bathing in the vanities across the
Square.”</p>

<p>There was a herd of carriages at the entrance to the
famous ball-room; and under the awnings he encountered
the quick, natty figure of the much-liked Finacune—seized
the shoulders of the little man affectionately.</p>

<p>“Hello, old heart—my first glimpse of a white man
in the Home-zone——”</p>

<p>Finacune turned in an abrupt, unnerved way. “Why,
how d’ do, Routledge?” he mumbled throatily. His
right hand had jerked toward the other from habit, but
was withdrawn without the clasp. “How d’ do? Comin’
in, I s’pose?”</p>

<p>With this astonishing greeting, the <i>Word</i> man leaped
up the stone steps and left his “mystic of the wars”
beneath the dripping canopy, not a little perturbed. The
rather intent regard of the cab-starter pulled Routledge
from his reflecting after a moment, and he followed
Finacune into the Hall, being shown at once to the gentlemen’s
coat-room. Apparently Finacune had shed his
outer garment with incredible speed, for he was not
there; nor any other guests. Routledge’s first thought
was that a joke was being perpetrated at his expense,
Finacune’s action merely preparing the way, but he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
not hold fast to this. His whole nature was sensitive at
once to a formidable disorder.</p>

<p>His name trembled above the sense-stirring music as
he stepped upon the floor of the brilliant hall. It was
a distinguished company of admirals, generals, civilian
campaigners, and exalted representatives of the Home,
Foreign, and Colonial Departments; the bravest men of
the kingdom, perhaps; certainly some of the fairest
women. The throng moved about in a slow, suppressed
way; and the faces turned toward him not gladly, not
pointedly, but in a quick, secretive, on-the-defensive
fashion, as upon some huge agent of menace and craft.</p>

<p>With difficulty, Routledge controlled the muscles of
his face. The public speaker knows the moment. Here
is straightforward testimony of the power of mind over
matter. That first volume of abhorrence and distrust
which his eyes had ever met, seemed to rub out his
features and weave its own image upon the flesh. He
never forgot the sensation. Women craned their heads
behind the shoulders of the men. A steward passed
before him, fell into the current of hatred, and his face
altered visibly. Routledge summoned all his resistance
and smiled. He understood instantly that only a few
of the men, the most valued tools of the kingdom, knew
the specific allegation, and that by the others he was
charged with some dreadful generality. Finacune had
disappeared. Jerry Cardinegh had not arrived. Trollope,
that goodly bullock of a man, most slow of all to be
blown in a gale of popular opinion, stood nearest to
Routledge. The two faced each other fixedly.</p>

<p>“I say, brother, what’s up?” Routledge inquired
lightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“I was thinking of interviewing you on the matter—not
for publication, of course, but for my own curiosity,”
was the puzzling answer.</p>

<p>Routledge quickly stepped forward, but Trollope
turned away.</p>

<p>Burling-Forster, an artillery chieftain, whose valor,
years before at Quetta, had vividly been placed before the
British people by Routledge, the only civilian detached
with him at the time, took the place of Trollope now
and stared with steady, stony insolence, an accomplishment
of Englishmen only, at the man who had made him
famous. He did not move to take the hand which
Routledge was careless enough to offer him. However,
Burling-Forster uttered a sentence which showed that
he quite forgot that there were women in the room.</p>

<p>There was not a shade of change now in the brown
hue of Routledge’s face, nor in the pleasure of his smile.</p>

<p>“Colonel, I once saw your temper working to better
effect,” he said courteously.... “Feeney,” he
remarked, turning to the grim visage of the old man,
“perhaps you may tell me—am I out of order to inquire
what this game is?”</p>

<p>“It appears to me,” Feeney answered gloomily, “that
you are out of order anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Thank you—I didn’t know.”</p>

<p>It was now the turn of Dartmore, the editor of the
<i>Review</i>. As has been related, it had been the recent
vocation of Routledge to make this newspaper important
in and between wars. To be insulted by Dartmore
was like being thrown from a horse into a hedge of
Spanish-bayonets.</p>

<p>“I am glad that you were crafty enough not to call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
at the <i>Review</i> office to-day, though you’ve got hell’s
own audacity to come here. Don’t go to the <i>Review</i> for
your cheque. I will see to it that it is brought to the
Rubicon Buffet within an hour. I advise you to buy
something with it to kill yourself.”</p>

<p>A tall figure in evening wear brushed by Routledge
now, rather roughly and without apology. It was
Bingley, of the <i>Thames</i>. For an instant Routledge was
blinded—the Hindus name it well—by the red mists of
passion. He had drilled himself to bear the words, had
listened coldly, curiously, for the past few moments,
but the actual physical contact unleashed his rage.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t advise him to kill himself until he is
well clear of the shores of England, Dartmore—the taint,
you know!” Bingley said with a brassy smile.</p>

<p>The face of a woman hurrying toward him through
the breathless groups in the great reception hall pulled
Routledge out of delirium.</p>

<p>“Bingley,” he remarked, shutting his eyelids forcibly,
as if to expel the rheum of anger, “I’ll bear in mind
your suggestion.”</p>

<p>The editor turned his back upon his prince of servants,
as routine men frequently dare to do. A butler stood by
Routledge with the great frieze coat. The air became
electric with whisperings. The whole company was
intent upon a matter, the nature of which only a handful
knew. But the others discussed it in awed, hungry
eagerness—in that deplorable, hungerish way of lesser
folk who are enabled to forget their own limitations by
the spectacle of one of the mighty fallen. Routledge
swung into his outer garment, smiling strangely....</p>

<p>Then the ladies of the kingdom gasped and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
valiants stared. A lady broke in through the narrowing
circle and ran to the outcast—a wondrous Irish lady
of red-gold hair and pale gold silk. Her hand fell upon
the sleeve of his great-coat, and her face, the masterpiece
from the famous gallery of Erin, was upturned proudly
but pitifully to his.</p>

<p>“They won’t tell me—they speak of treachery, but
no one dares to tell me—what is this horrid mistake?”
she demanded.</p>

<p>The sudden look of tenderness in Routledge’s eyes
gave way to fear and pain. The others had stepped back.</p>

<p>“Run away, you blessed girl,” he whispered. “Something
big is wrong. I seem to understand it least of all—but
its plain I’m bad medicine here now. It will all come
out. Meanwhile, don’t be seen with me, Noreen!” He
added in the shadow of a whisper, “Your father——”</p>

<p>“Father will be here to-night. He brought me to
the door, promising to be back within an hour. I think
he went to find you. Oh, he’s changed—more than I
feared! But you, Routledge-san——”</p>

<p>“Please leave me. You are assailing your position
by talking with me. That hurts worse than anything
these people might say. I shall go out and think it
over.... Good-night, Noreen, my dear friend.”</p>

<p>But she clung to his arm. “What do I care what
<i>they</i> think of me? I want <i>you</i> to know—you must
know when you are alone—that there is one woman who
will stand by you, through all things!”</p>

<p>Her words were not lost to the periphery of the
crowd. He drew back stoutly, but his heart sank when
she added even more loudly: “Remember, you have one
friend—even though all your brave companions fail!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>His lips moved with the words: “Dear Noreen—say
no more.”</p>

<p>“<i>Remember me!</i>” came back to him.</p>

<p>For an instant she watched as he turned to the door—lineage
to Plantagenet and stuff of angels warm in her
heart. The other women fathomed his attempt to shield
her from them and from her own impulsiveness. What
they thought of his gallantry they did not tell; but what
they thought of Noreen Cardinegh was revealed in
jewelled combs and in the elaborate artistry of back-hair
which met her eyes when she turned once more to
the hall.</p>

<p>“Mighty brave of you, I’m sure, Miss Cardinegh,”
said Bingley, stepping to her side. “I should like to
have a friend so loyal. But you’re wrong this time,
really——”</p>

<p>“Even so, Mr. Bingley, I shall trust to my own
judgment,” she answered, moving swiftly into the throng,
where he did not essay to follow.</p>

<p>Routledge had not missed the attitude of the Hall
toward her. The tempest of abhorrence, though a new
and very wonderful brand of battle, did not shatter his
philosophy, but the slight which his champion was enduring
for his sake—this was grim hell in his heart.</p>

<p>Outside he fought it, the roar of dripping London in
his ears. A cab drove up to the reception-canopy, and
her father, Jerry Cardinegh, stepped out—incredibly
shrunken, altered, and uncertain of step. Far different
had he left London for India less than a year before, a
hard, weathered, full-blooded man. Routledge hungered
now for his friend of friends, but he did not call.</p>

<p>In the Rubicon Buffet, across the Square, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
<i>Review’s</i> cheque was handed him presently by a messenger.
The outcast signed the receipt, and sat down
dazedly, forgetting to drink. An hour later, Burling-Forster
entered the buffet with some friends from the
Armory. The artilleryman saw Routledge at a far table
and backed out.</p>

<p>“We will go on,” said he. “I perceive that this is
no place for us.”</p>

<p>The manager’s quick eye had seen Burling-Forster’s
glance rest upon the solitary figure at the distant table,
and he stared doubtfully now at Routledge. The latter
rose and approached him. “Forgive me,” he said,
quitting the place. “Not for fortunes would I impair
the popularity of your excellent buffet.”</p>

<p>London had changed in an hour; it was pitiless, alien.
Yet he could laugh at London. The thought that made
him writhe had to do with the gorgeous woman who had
cast herself into the débris of his fortunes—the woman
who had meant so much to him in the silences of service....
He moved about in the fog; passed the <i>Review</i>
office, glanced up at the fourth floor, the blazing lights
just a pale glimmer now. Friends were there, putting
their best of brain and hand into the maw of the morning
paper. The cutting sentences of Dartmore returned,
and he did not go upstairs. In the little press-club around
the corner, the day men were in festival. Routledge
winced—and passed by. There was time still to catch
a night-train for Paris, but he couldn’t let the mystery
beat him, not even for the glisten of Paris—not for New
Jerusalem! He would wait and ask no questions. A
broad, low building very lavish with its music, lights,
and laughter appeared at length upon the right of way.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Routledge inquired of a policeman what was going on
within.</p>

<p>“It’s the cab-drivers’ annual ’op, sir,” the officer said.</p>

<p>“May one enter who is not a cab-driver at present?”
Routledge asked.</p>

<p>“’Avin’ the price, sir.”</p>

<p>All things to all men, Routledge fell gladly into the
gathering, buying seas of beer and continents of cake.
Within a half-hour he had telephoned to Rupley’s for a
ten-story confection, and presently many couples, shining-faced,
were preening and pirouetting for the possession
of it. Had he been the King’s groom, he could
not have mounted higher in the estimate of the guests.
His heart grew warm with the fun. It was after midnight
when the new social stratum tumbled about his
ears. The hard-headed little master of ceremonies
approached, very white and sorrowful:</p>

<p>“I regrets hexceedingly to say, sir, that one as ’as
been dismissed from the Harmy’s and the Noivy’s ’op,
sir, cawn’t rightly be expected to find a boith ’ere.”</p>

<p>Routledge had a large view of the world, and a compressed
notion of the personal equation, but his humor
did not save him now from being stung hard and deep.</p>

<p>“You are quite right, of course,” he said. “I’m very
sorry to have intruded, and very thankful for the good
time up to now. Good-night.”</p>

<p>There was a murmur of sorrow from many feminine
quarters when the great frieze coat was brought, but
it was quickly silenced by the undertone of intelligence
which spread like poison through the hall. The butler
at the Army and Navy reception had told one of the
drivers, who, turning up later at the celebration of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
own guild, found the outcast there. Thus have empires
fallen.</p>

<p>Routledge walked the full distance to his lodgings.
Sometimes he smiled; sometimes he found himself striding
forward with mad swiftness; then he would smile
again, and pull up to the pace of a leisurely gentleman
enjoying the night air. Entering his stairway in Bookstalls,
he just avoided stumbling over a little figure curled
up asleep. His heart went out to the street-waif. Here
was one, at least, in London who had no hate nor insult
for him. The impulse came to carry the little one up
into the warmth. Without waking, the child was placed
in a big chair before the grate-fire in the lodgings upstairs.
Then Routledge sat down to meditate.</p>

<p>“This is a merry old trail—God knows I love it!”
he muttered. “I have had what the good gray poet
would call a night of ‘richness and variety.’...
Perhaps I would be less happy did I know the breed of
incubus which has fallen upon me.... I shall probably
be turned out of here in the morning—perhaps be
cast into stone and steel. It is strange, strange, that I,
Routledge, whose business it is to tell the world the
gossip of inner courts and the issue of open fields—that
the point of my own fate should be buried in me
before I get a look at it!... And that wondrous
girl! Why did I not know her when the dust of the
world had not fallen upon me; when I had not looked
upon the world’s red wines—because they were red!...
Routledge, old wanderer, how often has some
woman arisen to save you from death—and now a woman
arises to save you from your friends!”</p>

<p>A watcher would have thought, for a long time afterward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
that Routledge dozed, with the stem of a <i>nargileh</i>
between his teeth, except for the soft bubbling in the
bottle and the tiny puffs of smoke at long intervals. The
dawn came in, graduated from gloomy gray to the dead-white
of a sunless morning.... The bell aroused
him. He arose and opened the door. Jerry Cardinegh
was on the stairs.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Routledge</span> stepped back from the open door. He
was afraid to extend his hand, lest it be repelled. When
the old man rushed across the landing and gripped him,
he felt a rather novel kindling of gladness.</p>

<p>“God, son!” Cardinegh muttered, sinking into a
chair. “I thought you had slipped London. This is the
third time I’ve been here the last ten hours.”</p>

<p>“It must have been three this morning when I came
in, Jerry, and I left about nine last night.”</p>

<p>“I was here between nine and ten, and again at
midnight.”</p>

<p>“Then you didn’t stay long at the Armory? You
don’t mean to say that the boys gave you an ovation—of
my kind? Miss Noreen must have told you.”</p>

<p>“Routledge,” the other said slowly, struggling to
get a tight rein upon a herd of flying faculties, “they
welcomed me in the old way, but the place was disordered.
You had been gone only a moment or two.
Noreen was waiting for me in the ladies’ room—ready
for the street. She would have gone home alone had I
not arrived just then. Hurrying me away, she told me
how you had been received. After that, she insisted upon
coming here with me, though I told her I wanted to talk
with you alone. Give me some whiskey.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>Routledge was startled by the shaking avidity with
which Cardinegh carried the raw spirit to his lips.</p>

<p>“We came here direct from the Armory—Noreen
and I,” he said breathlessly. “When we did not find
you, we drove back to Cheer Street—and tossed the
rest of the night. God pity her—I couldn’t tell her!
Routledge, I didn’t dare to tell her!... She
begged me to assure you again and again of her faith.
She will see you to-day——”</p>

<p>There was a faint sigh and a soft squirming from the
third chair before the fire. It had been turned away
from the light. Cardinegh jumped to his feet with
horror in his face.</p>

<p>“You’re nervous, old King-maker. Why, it’s just
a little London waif I picked up asleep in my stairway.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose he has heard what I’ve said?” the
old man demanded huskily.</p>

<p>“You haven’t said anything yet that the world might
not hear. Sit down and smoke, Jerry. God still reigns,
and we’re Home.”</p>

<p>Cardinegh stared at the little figure curled up before
the fire, catching his breath audibly.</p>

<p>“I’m all shot up,” he panted. “Say, but it’s like you,
son, to pick up the little outcast.”</p>

<p>Routledge smiled, because the last word had a big
and new meaning. “Perhaps our voices will bother him.
I’ll put the lad in the next room,” he said, and untangled
the knotted muddy laces, placing the wet, worn shoes
evenly before the fire. As he lifted the boy in his arms,
the eyes opened sleepily, but Routledge could not see
the face pressed against his shoulder. They were drowsy,
startled eyes, wise and very shiny, like those of a mouse.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
Routledge laid him upon his own bed and dropped a
blanket over him. “Poor little gaffer, you smell like
Bookstalls Road,” he muttered. “I could pick you out
blind among the odors of India. Nothing short of a
riot could keep you awake, but poor old Jerry will talk
easier with you here—and the door shut.”</p>

<p>He drew his chair close to the other, and said genially:
“And now, Jerry, tell me what is good for me to
know.”</p>

<p>“Did you have a ghastly night, son,—your first night
at Home in over a year?”</p>

<p>“I prefer to call it an interesting night.”</p>

<p>“You are about to rise with cumulative glory. Do
you remember our last talk in the field—the bivouac at
Bhurpal?”</p>

<p>Routledge nodded.</p>

<p>“And you suggested that the spies of the Russian
Bear had worked down over the hills, and looted certain
startling secrets having to do with British India?”</p>

<p>“It was only a suggestion. The facts are not clear
to me yet. There was a colossal derangement somewhere—the
same, I take it, that hurled England into alliance
with Japan. I appear to be the only man in London
who has been denied the truth.” Routledge reached for
the amber-bit of his <i>nargileh</i>.</p>

<p>“They say a man is last to hear what is going on in
his own house.”</p>

<p>“What is the parallel, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to come to that. All London does not know—except
that you are under a cloud for treachery. Forty
men in London know exactly what has happened in
India. Perhaps ten of this forty were at the reception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
last night. The forty believe you to be the man who
turned the monster trick in Afghanistan, well-called the
Buffer State. They are the exalted heads of Departments—Foreign,
Home, Colonial, War, and Secret-service
chiefs—men who live in the shadow of the Throne.
Six, at most, of the correspondents are in the secret. The
rest can’t tell what you did, but to them, just the same,
you are the ranking Iscariot.... Routledge, how
many men know the truth about Shubar Khan’s Lotus
Expedition?”</p>

<p>“Possibly the same forty men.”</p>

<p>“And the soldiers of Colonel Hammond’s regiment?”</p>

<p>“That is a historical mystery,” Routledge said.
“Many are dead; the rest scattered and lost. The secret
was miraculously preserved. Why, this is the masterpiece
of England’s department of espionage.”</p>

<p>“The records of Colonel Hammond’s debauch in
blood were stolen last autumn,” Cardinegh whispered.
“The whole story was stolen—Hammond’s confession,
the testimony of his court-martial, even to the disposal
of the men of his regiment—<i>the men who knew all</i>!...
God! what a story for Russia to put into the
hands of the thrice ten thousand sons and sons’ sons of
Shubar Khan in Afghanistan!”</p>

<p>Cardinegh laughed in an uncontrolled way.</p>

<p>“Routledge, my son,” he went on nervously, “when
the Pathans and the Afridis turn to war, British India
forgets her polo and her billiards and her forestry....
It all dates from the Kabul massacre—you remember,
sixteen thousand white men and women and children
killed. Colonel Hammond’s father and mother were
among the dead. He was but a mite of a boy then, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
it drove him mad when he became a man and was sent
back to the same service as a colonel. You are one of
the forty, Routledge. You know the story. The Khyber
Hills and the same old trail where his parents were slain
started a leak in Hammond’s skull. He was a good
officer before that, or he wouldn’t have been a colonel.
That leak grew into the torrent <i>which washed away the
mountain that fell upon Shubar Khan’s twenty-five hundred—men,
women and children—down below in the
valley</i>——”</p>

<p>“That’s a nice figure of speech,” Routledge said
soothingly. “But, Jerry, the facts, as I heard them were
these: Colonel Hammond lost his mother and father on
the same trail he was leading his troops over that night.
That he had gone mad, everybody grants—from much
brooding on the old Kabul massacre. He was out after
Shubar Khan with his regiment, and just before dusk
discerned the bivouac of the Pathans thousands of feet
below in a valley. Shubar Khan had fifteen hundred
soldiers, and a thousand women and children had joined
their men in camp.</p>

<p>“Hammond’s original idea was to meet the Pathans
in battle, but he happened to see this cliff hanging precariously
over the steep slope. Now Hammond was a
famed engineer. Mad as he was, he did not forget his
craft. As for the women and children whom his scouts
reported below—this only made the madman more keen.
Remember, his mother had died just there.... He
looked at the slope, and saw that if he could start the
cliff, he could send an avalanche upon the crowded camp.
It wasn’t fighting. England wouldn’t have done it, but
we’re dealing with the insanity of a single leader. Hammond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
had dynamite. Also the Pathans didn’t know that
the English regiment was above. The cliff was aimed
at the camp. The blast worked. Falling rock dug a
trench in the mountain, gaining tons of power every
foot of slide. What happened has been kept secret by
the British, but you and I know. Twenty-five hundred
Pathans—including a thousand women and children—were
buried alive. If Hammond had been able to keep
his remnant of a brain, it would never have come out,
but he was raving when he brought his outfit back to
headquarters, and this started his men to thinking. A
little thinking and they understood all. The towering
atrocity, no one denies, but it was done by a madman—not
by England, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“The Pathans thought it a natural landslide—until
last autumn,” Cardinegh remarked, and there was exultation
in his eyes.</p>

<p>A chill swept over Routledge for an instant, as if
he had been in the presence of a human without a soul.
The colossal havoc wrought decades ago by an insane
Englishman was not a thing to be talked about as
Cardinegh talked—his eyes gleaming with triumph.
Even the Afghans had never learned the truth, so perfect
was the British management. They looked upon the
avalanche as a dreadful chastisement of the gods. They
had gone back to scratch their rocky fields and raise their
scrawny lambs with a growing belief that the gods
wanted the English in their land, and that gods who could
turn loose mysterious landslides knew best.</p>

<p>The ghosts of Shubar Khan’s twenty-five hundred—trooping
through the monster hills on the darkest nights—they
could not speak. The soldiers of the mad colonel—had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
they not all been divided, sent to fill the loneliest
posts and the most hazardous fore-fronts, under the
eyes of the secret-service men who see all and say nothing?...
It was not England’s fault, this work of a
crazed Englishman who undertook to avenge the massacre
of the sixteen thousand. It was a thing to be
hidden deep in the hearts of a few—this grim and terrible
history.</p>

<p>To have Russia get it now—the indisputable documents—would
enable her to start Afghanistan boiling
again. The Border States and all India would be embroiled.
More than all, the British troops serving in
India would be lashed into mutiny by the story of what
happened to the men of Colonel Hammond’s regiment—the
men who knew all. Yes, Russia could build her great
war upon it—the long-prophesied war—and drive her
puppets against England for the possession of northern
India.</p>

<p>Routledge was filled with shuddering by these
thoughts of war, and by the man before him, laughing
softly, insanely, and drinking raw whiskey—another
Colonel Hammond in the flesh!</p>

<p>“Let me get this straight, Jerry,” he said lightly.
“One man steals the documents which tell the whole
truth about Shubar Khan, and puts the story in the hands
of the Russians——”</p>

<p>“And at what a time!” Cardinegh exclaimed passionately.
“When did Abduraman die?”</p>

<p>“Last October. He was a valuable man for the
British,” Routledge added thoughtfully. “He held the
Pathans and the Afridis from fighting the English, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
at the same time managed to avoid angering Russia. He
was the man for the Buffer State.”</p>

<p>“His sons are not so valuable.” Cardinegh chuckled.
“Abduraman died of a <i>stroke</i>, as the newspapers said.
It was a stroke!... When was Cantrell, the British
Agent in Kabul, murdered?”</p>

<p>“A month later.”</p>

<p>“When were we all called in from the field and
Bhurpal forgotten?”</p>

<p>“A month later still.”</p>

<p>“What a God-given time it was!” the old man
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Routledge saw the need of holding Cardinegh
together until he could get the whole story. “I can see
clearly how one man might use these documents to start
war in Afghanistan,” he capitulated; “how Russia could
spread the hell all along the border, supplying powder
and guns, and getting a formidable enemy launched
against England, before taking the field herself. I can
even see how all India, ‘seething with hatred for her
white child, the British foundling’—I always liked that
sentence—might arise and say, ‘This is the accepted
time.’ More than that, I can see how the story of Colonel
Hammond’s lost regiment might start a contagion of
mutiny patches over the British army——”</p>

<p>“Some work for one man.”</p>

<p>“Big work, Jerry,” Routledge agreed. “I can see it
all so far, but you will have to pardon me for having a
little interest left in the fact, that I was practically
ejected from the Armory last night.”</p>

<p>The old man fell silent and his fears whipped him
again. “Don’t murder me until I am through, son.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
You are supposed to be the man who gave the story to
the Russian spies.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Routledge. “I am supposed to be the
man, and yet no one consulted me upon the matter. If
I were merely <i>supposed</i> to be the man—would I have
been turned out?”</p>

<p>“The forty who know the story—have no doubt
about you.”</p>

<p>Here a great light was thrown upon the recent activity
of the White Mustache. “Why am I not arrested,
Jerry?”</p>

<p>“The Government does not dare.”</p>

<p>“Publicity?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. The truth about Afghanistan to-day is a
secret guarded with men’s lives. Arbitration is afire
between here and Petersburg. If India and Russia saw
the British people aroused, the chances are that they
would be forced to strike at once. Soldiers are being
rushed secretly toward Khyber Pass. Troop-ships are
embarking suddenly and without ostentation from England
this moment. To make this story public—and this
would be in danger by your arrest—would start the
Indian sympathizers around the world. The mere name
of Shubar Khan brings old England to her knees. This
has been a pregnant day in the Inner Circle, my son.
No, you will not be arrested.”</p>

<p>“Why am I not murdered quietly?”</p>

<p>“The same reason, with another. I attended to that.
Every one who knows this story of Shubar Khan must
be reckoned with. I told them that you must be kept
alive—that I could secure your written confession. They
believe that I am at it now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>Routledge was throwing the whole strength of his
concentrated faculties into the eyes of the old man.
Cardinegh’s face was like death.</p>

<p>“Where did you meet the secret agents?”</p>

<p>“At Naples. They had me on the carpet almost
before I left ship.”</p>

<p>“This is the most absorbing tale I have ever encountered,
Jerry. I am to give you a written confession of
how I fell in with the Russians and gave them the documents
concerning Shubar Khan, which I had stolen.
Why did you choose me to make this confession—because
I am your best friend?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Cardinegh answered hoarsely; “because you
are my best friend. Not another man in the world would
have carried the burden for me. They would never have
let me reach London.”</p>

<p>Routledge bent forward and spoke with lowered
voice: “Then it was you who fell in with the Russians——”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Routledge couldn’t help it—the presence of the other
put a poisoned look into his face for an instant. The last
fifteen minutes he had endured every phase of astonishment
and horror. The revelation shook the psychic roots
of his being.</p>

<p>“For the love of God, son—don’t look at me that
way! Wait till I have told you all. I thought you were
already in London—with Noreen. I was in Italy, and
they never would have let me reach here. I never could
have seen her—or Cheer Street again.”</p>

<p>Pity came to Routledge. He looked down upon the
wreck of Jerry Cardinegh. He caught up his own nerve-ends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span> 
and bound them together, smiled, and placed his
hand upon the old man’s knee.</p>

<p>“How often I have found it,” he said musingly,
“that a day like yesterday portends great events. I had
the queerest sort of a day yesterday, Jerry. Hour after
hour I sat here, neglecting things which needed doing,
thinking, thinking. I have found it so before in my
life—days like yesterday preceding a crisis....
Weren’t any of the other boys suspected, or any of the
soldiers? Why was it that the finger of the episode
pointed to you or me?”</p>

<p>“Since October the whole occult force of the Empire
has been upon the case,” Cardinegh answered. “It was
a civilian job on the face of it. That was incontrovertible.
All the other boys fell under the eyes of the
service. They didn’t know it, of course, but each day
of the past four months we have been covered, our pasts
balanced. One after another, the process of elimination
vindicated them—all but you and me. Your infernal
habit of campaigning alone was against you, your being
an American, your Brahmin affiliations, your uncanny
knowledge of the Great Inside. Still, they took nothing
for granted. At Naples two agents drew me to cover,
demanding what I knew. It was you or I. They knew
it, and I knew it. The bulk of suspicion leaned your
way. I shaped more evidence against you, hinted that
I could secure your confession, if they only let me alone
until I could get to you.”</p>

<p>“Tell me again just why, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Because I wanted a day—just one day! I hadn’t
seen Noreen for nearly a year. I wanted a day with her.
I needed to arrange her affairs. God help me, Routledge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
I wanted her to love the old man—one more day! I
couldn’t cable you. I thought—I thought you would
hold the weight one day—for old sake’s sake!”</p>

<p>“And what do you propose to do, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“I have had my day. I am going to the War Department
with the facts this morning!”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“Vanish.”</p>

<p>“And your daughter—Miss Noreen?”</p>

<p>Cardinegh swallowed with difficulty. His unsteady
fingers fumbled at the place where a man in the field
carries a bit of ordnance. The ghost of a smile shook
itself out on his face.</p>

<p>“Don’t think I am sorry,” he said. “I joggled the
seats of the mighty. It was a life’s work. I’ve got my
joy for it. It’s not what I expected—but it’s done. I
can’t see the good of it clear as I did—but it’s done.
Only I wanted to look it in the face like the old Jerry
Cardinegh might have done—not sick, shaking, and half-drunk.
I should have done it when the little house in
Cheer Street only meant to me a sweet resting-place
between wars. I burned out before the end, my son.”</p>

<p>“But Noreen——”</p>

<p>“In the name of God, don’t drive that home again!
She’ll never know what the forty know. She’s provided
for. I have had my day—thanks to you. They’ll let me
clear from England. I’m accustomed to take short-notice
trips, and to stay long. She will hear—as she
always feared some time to hear—oh, typhoid in Madagascar,
a junk murder up the Yangtse—potted somewhere!...
Blessed little Noreen. In tears she
told me what had happened to you at the Armory. Think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
how I felt, son. She loves you, Routledge. What—what
I’ve done doesn’t affect her value—in your eyes?”</p>

<p>“Jerry, how did you get away with this thing in
India?”</p>

<p>“Nobody knows but me. I suppose I’d better tell
you. Before my last short trip home, there was a rumor
of fighting in Afghanistan. You remember, eight or nine
British correspondents gathered there, including you and
me. Cantrell and I were rather close; and old Abduraman,
I think, trusted me more than any of the others, on
account of my age and service. He was an insatiable
listener, and a perfect, an improved, double-action pump.
I think it was one of the elements of his greatness—the
wily old diplomat.</p>

<p>“Any way, I was closeted with him many times.
You would come in at night after studying the strategic
points of that devil’s land; no doubt, from Kabul to the
Pass. For once in my life, I was content with office
work. I mean Abduraman’s court and his <i>thoughts</i>.
Then, too, I was much with Cantrell, who was a sort of
secret-service chief in that district, as you well understand.
From time to time the different agents would
come in for a night—the men who do the dirty work for
England.”</p>

<p>Cardinegh’s eyes blazed again. With a few admirable
sentences, Routledge steadied him and regained the continuity....</p>

<p>“It was a still night, hot as hell,” Cardinegh went
on. “Kabul can be hot when the winds die down from
the mountains—but you were there that night. You
know. I was in Cantrell’s house. Three of the Nameless
who serve England with their lives, and are satisfied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
with a cipher message or a whispered word of praise
from some head of department——”</p>

<p>“I’ve studied the secret service, Jerry,” Routledge
ventured mildly. “It is interesting, but I’m more interested
to know what happened.”</p>

<p>“We all proceeded to relax. The devil in me would
not be burned by the fieriest wines. Remember, Cantrell
was a weak man, but sincere. The other three had been
studying Afghanistan against towering odds. They knew
more about the inner life of the Buffer State than any
three white men, not excepting Cantrell and yourself,
between Persia and British India. They were sure of
Cantrell. As for old Jerry Cardinegh—why, they took
me for granted.</p>

<p>“Presently—it was very late—everybody but old
Jerry had the bars down and soaked. Then I ventured
to open the question of Colonel Hammond. It was an
old story to Cantrell and to the three—not a new story
to me, but a strange one. I was fascinated by the inside
talk. Here were men who had kept the secret for years;
the men—at least, two of them—who had helped to
scatter the British troops of Colonel Hammond.</p>

<p>“Suddenly Cantrell arose and staggered to his safe,
glancing at the shut door and the open windows of the
office. He fumbled with the knob for a long time before
the big door swung open. Then with small keys which
he found inside he got into the inner compartment and
drew forth a fat envelope.</p>

<p>“‘Speaking of Colonel Hammond,’ Cantrell said, with
a drunken smile, ‘I’ve got the whole documents here.
They were never trusted to the mails, but they trusted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
me. I’ve never brought them out before—but we have
fallen into the arms of our friends. Isn’t it so?’</p>

<p>“We all acquiesced, and then there was interesting
reading. Routledge, it was the great story I had been
looking for—all that I wanted to know about one of the
most damnable military expeditions ever transacted. I
said to myself the world ought to know about this. That
was because I was a newspaper man. Then I said again,
‘The world ought to know about this,’ and that was the
humanitarian end. I was thinking of Ireland and India.</p>

<p>“Two of the secret-service men were asleep finally.
Cantrell moved about and served on legs of hot wax.</p>

<p>“‘I’m glad you put that back in the safe, Cantrell,’
I said, when the envelope was safely in my pocket. ‘You
could do a lot of damage to England with that just
now.’</p>

<p>“I glanced at the secret agent who was awake, and
found that he was not in on my steal. I should have
made a joke of it, if he had been. The fact is, I did not
really have the idea of stealing the papers until I found
that I had done it.... Cantrell locked the safe,
and the world was mine—all in a coat pocket!... You
mind, when Cantrell was killed, or assassinated, the
safe was blown open—quite a while afterward? I had
been back to England and to Ireland with Noreen in
the meantime.</p>

<p>“God, how I have whipped the English!... When
your name was spoken last night at the Armory,
the faces about me were like a lot of blood-mad dogs—nostrils
dilated and hackles up. I had to love you,
Routledge, to turn loose upon you—the Hate of London!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“And you had the Hammond papers all the time you
were in England and Ireland?” Routledge inquired.</p>

<p>“Of course. I had only a few weeks in Europe before
I was called back to the Bhurpal skirmish-stuff. You
had stayed in India——”</p>

<p>“But when and where did you get the papers to the
Russian spies, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“In Bhurpal—as that affair opened. It was weeks
before I met you that night of the gathering when the
two British forces came together. I stopped at the Rest
House in Sarjilid, on the way by train from Calcutta to
the front. It was there I heard a Russian sentence from
an alleged Parsee. I was onto the spy in a moment, but
first I want to tell you why I turned over the papers to
him. First, rather, I want a drink of whiskey. I’m talking
thick and fast, and it burns out the energy.”</p>

<p>Routledge served him. “Why you gave Cantrell’s
papers to the first Russian spy you met in India is what
I want to know,” he said carelessly.</p>

<p>“Listen, then. The idea came to me before I went
out to India on that Bhurpalese mix-up. I told you that
Noreen and I took a little trip to Ireland. I shouldn’t
have gone back to Tyrone—where her mother bloomed—where
I was a boy. I shouldn’t have gone back!”</p>

<p>The old man’s voice trembled, but he did not lose his
point.</p>

<p>“As it was, my son, the thoughts of Noreen’s mother
and Ireland were burning too deep in memory....
But we went back. The sun was going down on the
little town. It was dirty, shrunken, decayed—that old
stone city—and the blithest place a youth ever met a
maiden, or passed his boyhood.... Ah, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
mothers and youths and maidens and the memories of
old Tyrone always sung in my heart—when I could
forget England!”</p>

<p>Routledge lit a cigarette over the lamp and handed
it to Cardinegh without speaking. Jerry did not continue
for a moment. Then followed the impression his birthplace
made upon him—the veteran with his daughter:</p>

<p>“I can’t forget our last look—the old town, shrunken
and silent in the midst of her quarries. I heard the muttering
in the doorways, as we have heard it in India.
The best blood had gone to America; the knitting-works
were shut down—the remnant starving. It was like India
in plague and famine, but I could have borne that....
It was the next morning when I saw the British
garrison quartered upon the town——”</p>

<p>“You know how Colonel Hammond felt when something
sprung a leak in his brain,” Routledge suggested.</p>

<p>“You’ve hit it, boy.... There was the old
town, starving at best, with three hundred British soldiers
devouring its substance! It made me think of a fallen
camel—with a red-necked vulture for every bone in the
carcass. And that’s Ireland and that’s India!”</p>

<p>The whiskey was bright in the old man’s eyes.
“Look out, Routledge, when you hear a snap in your
brain! You said something to that effect....
I went back to India, as you know, up from Calcutta to
Sarjilid, where I met the Russo-Parsee. I thought of
Noreen and her mother, and Tyrone, and the service of
England, which I know as well as you. I thought of
India.</p>

<p>“What did I find in Sarjilid? There was a famine
there, too, and a garrison of red-necked vultures; sand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
blowing down from the windy hills; stench from the
huts; voices from the doorways; a salt-tax that augmented
the famine because the people needed but could
not buy their own product; naked brown children, fleshless
as empty snake-skins—but I won’t go on! I must
go to the war-office presently.... It was at Sarjilid
that I met the Russian.... It may be that I am
another Colonel Hammond, but I gave the documents
away. He was an enchanting chap—that Russian!”</p>

<p>Cardinegh here whispered the details of his treachery.
The politics of the world would not be cleaned by the
dialogue, but the big fact remains that the documents
concerning Colonel Hammond’s dynamite went into Russian
hands—a fire-brand for her to ignite Afghanistan,
the Indian Border, and British mutinies.</p>

<p>“Then I went back into the field to watch. Weeks
passed,” he continued hastily. “We met in Bhurpal, and
you told me what you had discovered. I knew. Each
day was a brimming beaker of joy to me then. I saw
British India shudder at the broken vessel of her secrets.</p>

<p>“Routledge, it was as if you struck a viper in the
spine. British India curled up. I had struck her in the
spine. She writhed and curled up!”</p>

<p>Cardinegh laughed again. “Ireland will be rid of
British garrisons. They will travel oversea to fight the
Afghans and the Russians now. The red-necks at Sarjilid
won’t have to travel so far! There’ll be a fifty-mile
battle-front, as you said—you ‘amateur prophet’! You
and the other boys will campaign—but old Jerry won’t
be there. I’ve had my day—and this is another one.
I’m off to lift your load, my son.”</p>

<p>The veteran campaigner arose and donned his coat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
Routledge was pacing up and down the room. Cardinegh
reached the door, and, holding to the knob, spoke again:</p>

<p>“I know what you think, my son. You think that
my plan miscarried. You think that England spoiled
my work—that her treaty with Japan was my answer.
You think that England will rub away the rest of the
insulation between Russia and Japan, and that the Bear
will fuse into the Rising-Sun—that all this will pull
Russia up from the border of British India. Ah! 
... and you think well. I can’t see it all as clear as
I did once. I can’t feel the thought of failure as I did
once. England has time to strengthen her borders and
cover her nakedness if Russia and Japan fight—but the
story of Shubar Khan is told and my work done! It’s
the initial lesion, Routledge, and the veins of British
India are running with the toxin of a disease—sometimes
amenable to heroic treatment—like the Anglo-Japanese
Alliance—but always incurable!”</p>

<small>ROUTLEDGE BEGS FOR A STIMULANT—THE STUFF
THAT SINGS IN THE VEINS OF KINGS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Rain</span> upon the windows. The atmosphere was heavy
in the lodging, heavy from a sleepless night. Tobacco
ash upon the floor; white embers in the grate; the finer
ash of burned emotions in the eyes of the men. Neither
had spoken for several moments.... Whose was
to be the desolation of war? Was North China or China
South soon to rumble with the tramp of foreign armies?
Routledge put the question away among the far concerns
of his mind. It was a moment now to mourn the man
before him. There never had been an instant of hate for
Jerry Cardinegh—perhaps, a full sweep of horror, at first,
but that was gone, and in its wake was a pity of
permanence.</p>

<p>He mourned his friend who was mad, dead. The
years had wrought a ghastly trick here. Under many
constellations, he had heard Cardinegh whisper his passionate
hatred for England and her relation to Ireland
and to India. Not a little of it Routledge himself shared.
He perceived now that this passion had devoured the
reason and sweetness of the old man’s mind. The
Cardinegh of old days looked no longer out of these
hunted, red-lit eyes. A pestilence had deranged the well-loved
face. It was evil now in the fire-light—like a
tampered chart. A life of brooding had vanquished the
excellent humor at the last. Oppression had nursed a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
demon to obsess the brain and make a shudder of a good
name.</p>

<p>“I must go,” Cardinegh said roughly. “It is my
last day. This morning my final arrangements for
Noreen. An hour with her—then to the war-office with
the revelation. You’ll stay here, son. Stick to these
walls—until Dartmore and the boys bring your glory
back to you.... I can see them trooping in!...
And Noreen—ah, the gladness of her!”</p>

<p>Routledge opened wide the windows and stood by
while the morning swept in, damp, chill, but cleansing.</p>

<p>“Sit down a moment more, Jerry,” he said finally.
“I want to ask a favor of you. It is a hard thing, a
delicate thing—harder and more delicate than the thing
you trusted to me, without asking. There is no other
white man whom I would dare ask such a favor.”</p>

<p>“Out with it, son.” Cardinegh watched him wonderingly.
Routledge sat down and leaned forward, a fine
light in his big, calm eyes.</p>

<p>“I told you I had passed an interesting night, Jerry.
It was more than that—a wonderful night. Thoughts
have come to me that never squirmed in mortal brain
before. I felt this vast moil of London—my enemy!
I felt it gathering about my ears like the <i>Tai Fung</i> in
the China sea. It was rich, incomparably rich, the stimulus
of a Cæsar—this Herod-hate of seven million souls!
I’ve been thinking for hours, Jerry—and I should have
been writing—stuff for glory—the great book! Whiskey
wouldn’t bring out such work, nor drugs, nor Yogi
asceticism. I have glimpsed such work in stars, in battle-smoke,
in bivouac fires, in the calm and distances of the
monster Himalayas; perhaps in the eyes of women—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
glimpses only, Jerry! To-night it came like a steady
stream of empyrean fire. I want months of it—months!
I would pay half my life to have London and the army
hating me this way until the work is done. It’s the
stuff that sings in the veins of kings. Give it to me—for
the book!”</p>

<p>“Wake up! You fool—wake up!”</p>

<p>“Listen, old champion,” Routledge went on passionately:
“I have spent this life gathering the data of
experience. I have crossed the Sahara in the hue and
garb of a camel driver; I have lain months a yellow
Mohammedan in the huts of Lahore; as a Sannyasi, I
have trudged up to the roof of the world. And the fighting,
Jerry—Pathan, Zulu, and Burmese; and the revolts—Afghan,
Balkan, Manipur, African, Philippine—all
these came back, vivid, splendid last night—pictures fit to
gild and garnish the Romance of the Open. And, Jerry,
I have peered into the mystic lore of India, the World’s
Mother—subtly and enticingly to color it all! I want
to do this, Jerry, the Book of our Tribe! I shall write
it in blood, with pillars of fire leaping up for chapter-heads—if
you will only leave this flood of power in my
veins—the Hate of London!”</p>

<p>Cardinegh, gasping, clutched his hand. “One of us—you
or I—is mad——”</p>

<p>“Mad, of course,” laughed Routledge. “A man must
be a little mad with the inspiration of Keats and the
punch of Carlyle banging together in his brain.”</p>

<p>Hope lived wildly now in Cardinegh’s eyes. “And
while you are doing the book,” he muttered, “I am to
live out your tinsel and truffles here, play the grizzled
warrior—led about by the child of her mother....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
Routledge—Routledge, your brand of stimulus is new
and raw.”</p>

<p>“I’m tolerated to ordinary poisons, Jerry. A man
immersed in gentle azure can’t get the other pigments
out of his brain.”</p>

<p>Cardinegh arose. “It’s sweet heaven to me,” he
murmured strangely, with quivering lips. “It is a rest
such as I have never known. I never was ready to rest
until now, until to-day—when I thought the chance was
burned away. You want to take this?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Months of life—Home, Noreen!... Damme,
Routledge—I’m broken! It’s like you, Routledge—it’s
like you——”</p>

<p>“To me it’s a gift of the gods! Hold on, Jerry, until
I bring back the Book—hold on and sit tight!”</p>

<p>Cardinegh left the lodging and Bookstalls, bewildered
by his new possession of days. The strain that had kept
him afoot until the end; that had stiffened his body and
faculties for the end itself; carrying him step by step
from the Khyber Hills, through the Bhurpal campaign
(the days in which he had watched the results of the
fire he had started); the strain that had roused his personal
craft to baffle and disarm those men of uncanny
keenness at Naples, and pulled him up for a last rally
in London—was lifted now, and with it relaxed the substance
of his brain and body. Doubtless, he would have
preserved his acumen upstanding, and an unsnapped
nerve, to bid Noreen farewell and make his confession at
the War-Office to-day—but there was no need!</p>

<p>The old man walked along mumbling, forgetting the
while to hail a cab. The miracle of it all, though it did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
not appeal to him, was that he had lost his ruling, destroying
hatred for England. Cheer Street and Noreen—the
blessedness of her hand to help him; her touch so like
her mother’s upon his brow; the eyes of her mother
across the table—months of life, of rest, of Home and
Noreen!... These were his thoughts. There was
no room for world-politics, for war, for passion. Even
the thing which Routledge had done hovered in the background.
It was a piece of inhuman valor, almost too big
to hold fast to. Routledge was identified in his brain
now with the stirring braveries of days long gone; with
other sunlights in which men met the shock of things
in full manhood; it was of another, of a ruddier, world to
old Jerry’s eyes to-day.... In a remote way, he
felt that once <i>he</i> might have revelled in the hate of
London. Perhaps it was one of the things peculiar to
the middle distances of manhood—as far from the comprehension
of the elders as of the children. That there
was an element of sacrifice in the action of Routledge
was not entirely lost to Cardinegh, but he put it away
among the misty glories of memory—days when manhood
was in its zenith of light and power. It was not
of the present; it had nothing to do with the numbness
and the swift, painless softening of to-day.</p>

<p>“Noreen!” he called, at the front door in Cheer
Street.</p>

<p>A servant told him that Noreen had been away for
an hour.... With a startled look, the servant drew
a chair close to the fire for the old man, poured a grog
for him, set his smoking things to hand, and backed
staring out of the room.... Hours afterward,
Noreen found him there—the glass, the pipes, the daily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
papers untouched. His smile was like something which
the wind had blown awry. His eyes were depleted of
fire, of fury. Even the starry worship which her presence
had reflected in them yesterday was dimmed—as
were the mighty images of the wars in his brain....
He roused at the sight of her, started to speak of
Routledge, halted, reflected, then drank.</p>

<p>“Hold a match to my pipe, child. It was your
mother’s way. You’ve been gone the long while, deere.”</p>

<p>She obeyed. The majesty of pain was upon her face
as she hurried away. Locked in her own room, long
afterward, she heard him humming quaveringly an old
Irish folk-song—lost from her brain a dozen years.</p>

<small>THE SUPERLATIVE WOMAN EMPTIES HER HEART OF
ITS TREASURES FOR THE OUTCAST, AND
THEY PART AT CHARING CROSS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> taking the hand of Jerry Cardinegh at the
stairs, Routledge returned to his room, smiling a trifle
bitterly.</p>

<p>“That was certainly a fragile underpinning to rear
a great lie upon,” he mused. “I couldn’t have made old
Jerry swallow that a year ago.... But there’s good
humor in the idea—the book of Routledge energized by
the dynamos of British hate—a book of wars from a man
who rather likes to promote the ranking rottenness of
war.... But the name of Cardinegh cannot go
down just yet with that of Colonel Hammond, and the
Lotus Expedition; with treachery.... Living God,
how that sweet girl haunts me!... I must put
her away—far back among the cold, closed things. It
isn’t fair to use her as a trellis for thought-vines like
mine. She is just psychic enough to know, without
words——”</p>

<p>He thought presently of what Rawder had told him
about returning to India this year; also of Noreen’s
amendment—that he was to go very quickly. How far
off it had seemed yesterday!... Routledge was
standing at the window. Though his active mind was
filled with sadder, finer matters, a process of unconscious
cerebration was alert for the White Mustache in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
street below. This certain secret agent was not in sight,
but there was not a single individual of the throng who
<i>might not</i> be identified with that silent, fameless department—the
men who had kept the secret of Shubar Khan
in spite of Colonel Hammond’s regiment, which knew all....
London was running with its sordid morning
business—grinding by in the gray morn and the rain.</p>

<p>“London,” he exclaimed softly, marvelling at the
great thing which had befallen him, “the keyboard of the
planet! How the Excellent Operator hungers to turn
the full voltage on me now!”</p>

<p>Routledge was hard-hit, and made no pretenses to
himself otherwise. He did not want to go back to India
to-day. The thing he had managed to pray for—the
Hate of London—was a crippling horror. It tore down
the inner life of him. He felt already the encompassing
loneliness of an expatriate; worse, he felt against him
the gigantic massed soul of the English. It peopled the
shadows of the room and the street and his brain, filling
him with weakness and faltering. It was not that the
idea of death hung to the flanks of his being. He could
laugh at death with a sterling principle. Rather, it was
that all that had bound him to life was dead—work and
play and light. He was chained to a corpse—the hate of
London. It was an infectious corrosion which broke
his own spirit, as no physical dread had ever done; yet,
stricken as he was, he felt himself torn in the counter-attraction
of two great passions—between his sweetest
woman and his bravest man.... A light rapping
at his inner door startled him. It was the Bookstalls
boy.</p>

<p>“Kin I come out now, Mister?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>With a gasp of relief, Routledge turned to the door;
but, on the way, his eyes fell upon the two worn, fallen-in
shoes, set so evenly before the fire.</p>

<p>“Bless you, lad—just a minute,” he said.</p>

<p>He gathered up all the change his pockets had held,
big and little pieces of silver, and dropped them softly
into the shoes, now stiffly dried,—then opened the door.
The small, draggled chap emerged briskly, took in his
host from head to foot with a quick, approving look,
then glanced out of the window to locate himself. It
was all coming back to him apparently.</p>

<p>“I was sleepin’ in yer street-stairs,” he explained, as
if to get it straight in his own mind. “Then I didn’t
know nothink till I ’eerd woices.”</p>

<p>“What’s your name, little soul?”</p>

<p>“Johnny Brodie.”</p>

<p>“Did the voices bother you, Johnny?” Routledge
asked.</p>

<p>“Naw. I was too warm. Nothink like woices never
bothers when you’re warm. Is them your stairs? Nobody
never come up them stairs late afore.”</p>

<p>“Have you slept there often, Johnny?”</p>

<p>“Not wery,” the boy said nervously.</p>

<p>He had given Routledge a start for a moment. It
was not past the White Mustache to have used a lad of
this size, but, once used, the lad would never have spoken
of “woices.” Besides, he had slept on the stairs before.
Johnny was looking about the walls with covert appreciation.
Guns, saddles, and soldier-pictures appealed to
him. They were proper man-things.</p>

<p>“How long have you been in Bookstalls, and around
here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“Allus.”</p>

<p>“But haven’t you any place to sleep?”</p>

<p>“Lots.” It wasn’t said with humorous intent.
Johnny Brodie was struggling with his shoes.</p>

<p>Routledge regarded him with joy.</p>

<p>“Lor-gordy,” muttered Johnny, in an awed voice.
“Wishermay die if you ain’t tipped over a bank in me
boots!... Mine?”</p>

<p>Routledge nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m chivvied! I ’ont be safe nowheres wit
all this.”</p>

<p>“Johnny, are all your places to sleep like my stairs?
I mean, haven’t you any regular place?”</p>

<p>The boy gave him a quick glance and decided that
this was not the time for lies.</p>

<p>“Lor-gordy—them stairs ain’t bad—on’y wen it’s
wery cold. Naw, I ain’t got nothink reg’lar.”</p>

<p>“There’s a bit of a room just your size, Johnny, in the
back-hall,” the man said. “I’m going away again to-day,
and these rooms will be locked up for a long time, but
I’ll be back, I think. If I were to fix it with the good
landlady for you to have that little room—and I’ll give
you a regular army blanket like the soldiers have, to
curl up in when it’s cold, and a little cot, and all the
things you need—would you use it every night?”</p>

<p>“Lor’! Say, Mister, honest?”</p>

<p>He nodded. “Run along then, Johnny, and get a
good breakfast, and I’ll have it arranged when you get
back.”</p>

<p>Routledge came to an agreement with the woman of
the house; carried from his own rooms blankets, soap,
towels, pictures, a pair of military brushes, an unused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
pocket-knife, a package of candles, and many other little
things to the wee box of a room in the hall, taking
much pleasure in the outfitting.... He had
not yet brought his own baggage from Charing
Cross, and was glad now. London had become to him
like a plague quarantine, a smothering menace. He
would leave London to-day, and Noreen Cardinegh, without
daring to see her again. His every movement, he
realized, was watched. Even to take her hand for a
moment would reflect evil upon her. The White Mustache,
or one of his kind, would observe, and a lasting
record would be made. He paced the floor swiftly,
murdering the biggest thing in his life.</p>

<p>... He could go to Rawder. There was healing
in that. Perhaps the old Sannyasi would take him for
the <i>chela</i> of his <i>chela</i>. He could hide in England’s India,
which only a few of the secret service knew so well as
he.... Could he put all the wars and illusions of matter
away, drink of the ancient wisdom, wander beneficently
until the end, with two holy men, in the midst
of God’s humblest poor? Could he put behind him all
that was supreme and lovely of his life this hour, sink
it in the graveyard of his past with other dead desires?</p>

<p>It was just a rush of vague, vain thoughts. Had
he been pure as the boy, twelve years ago, and wise as
the man now, <i>and if he had never known Noreen
Cardinegh</i>, possibly then the old Sannyasi might say,
“Be the disciple of my disciple; and, free from all the
illusions of the flesh, journey with us up into the silence
of the goodly mountains.”...</p>

<p>But this life would never know freedom from that
thrilling, beautiful memory. He could sacrifice a union<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
with Noreen Cardinegh, but never renounce her from
the high place of his heart. She was wedded to the
source and centre of his life, and no asceticism could
shrive her from him. He might put half the planet’s
curve between, but the bride the world had formed for
him would be the eternal crying voice in the wilderness;
and until they were mated in this or another life, the
Wheel of Births and Deaths would never whirl him free
from love, the loftiest of all illusions. Though he sat in
a temple upon the roof of the world, holding his thoughts
among the stars until the <i>kusa grass</i> beneath him was
blown like dust away, and his body petrified upon the
naked rock, the last breath from the ruin would stir his
lips to the name of the world’s bright gift to him—Noreen.</p>

<p>Johnny Brodie returned. Routledge took him by the
hand and led him into the midst of his possessions....
It was quite a happy time, with the old landlady
looking on, and a mysterious fund in her pocket for
Johnny stockings, and Brodie trousers and even dinners,
when old Bookstalls was remiss in her duty. Finally, at
the last moment, Routledge dropped his hand upon the
boy’s shoulder. The face was turned up clear, the eyes
unblinking. The man was no longer afraid.</p>

<p>“Johnny,” he said, “the best fellows in this world
are those who are strong enough to hold their tongues
at the right time. Nobody must know about this little
room—<i>nobody</i>. To you, I’m just a decent stranger who
has gone away. If anybody asks who or where or how
or why about me—you don’t know. This is all yours.
Sleep tight, and say nothing. If you need anything that
you can’t get yourself, go to the landlady. Be clean about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
what you do everywhere—I don’t mean in the room,
Johnny, but everywhere, in the street, too. Not clean
about your hands and face—that’s good—but mostly
about what you think. I may come back some time, and
I may not, but you’ll be fixed here as long as you need.
Think of it, Johnny Brodie—remember this well: always
if something hits you from inside that a thing isn’t good
to do, don’t hurry about doing it. Think it over. If you
wouldn’t do it when the person you like best in the world
is watching, it isn’t a good thing to do alone.”</p>

<p>Routledge locked his lodgings. With the boy attached
to one hand and his bag in the other, he went down into
the street, and just at that moment a carriage opened at
the curb, and Noreen Cardinegh stepped out. Routledge
took the outstretched hand, but there was a warm flood
of pain widening within him, as blood from an opened
wound....</p>

<p>The rain-coat hung about her like a delicate harmony,
its hood covering her hair; and its high-rolling collar,
bound with scarlet, thin as a thread but vivid as an
oriflamme, concealed her throat. That lustrous, perfect
oval face in the rain. It was luminous from within like
a pearl, and had <i>its</i> scarlet-edging in the curving, exquisite
lips, strange with inner vividness. Never had she
been so wondrous to him as he felt the superb zest of life
beneath the pearl-gray glove that moment in grimy
Bookstalls. A conception of womanhood that widened
the limitations of any man!... He lifted his glance
from the pavement, where it had been held for an instant
by the glittering point of her boot, and found the great
eyes upon him—pools of splendor which held his temple,
white as truth, golden sunlight on its dome; and, far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
within, a dim, mystic sanctuary where Mother Earth
had built a shrine for him.</p>

<p>“Thank God you have not gone, Routledge-san!”
she said in a low way. “Tell me—ah, but I know—you
would have gone without a word to me.... You
think it is right?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why do you punish me this way, Routledge-san?...
Do you think I mind what London cares or
thinks? Do you think London could force me to believe
ill of you?... I must talk with you! May we
not go up into your rooms, out of the crowd and the
rain? The little boy may come.”</p>

<p>There was not a window commanding the street
which might not have held the White Mustache that
moment; not a single passer-by who might not have been
one of his kind.</p>

<p>“I have turned in my—that is, I have given up my
room,” he faltered.</p>

<p>“I must talk with you. Come into my carriage.
That will be the better way. The little boy——”</p>

<p>She caught the look of hostility in the street-waif’s
eyes. She was taking the man away. There was another
look, the meaning of which she did not miss. Routledge
bent down to him.</p>

<p>“Good-by, little soul,” he said. “I’ll find you in
some doorway again some time—maybe in the doorway
to fame. Be a good little fellow always. Don’t get
tired of being clean, and some time you’ll be mighty
glad.”</p>

<p>The boy watched the carriage move slowly away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
among the truckage—until a stranger put a hand upon
his shoulder.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>For many seconds neither spoke; then it was Noreen.</p>

<p>“What is this big thing you are doing, Routledge-san?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell—even you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you need not have hurt me so. You were
going away without a word to me—and I am so proud to
have been for you—against the others.”</p>

<p>“Noreen, you must believe that it is not good for
you to be seen with me now. Every movement I make
is known; everyone in the slightest communication with
me is under suspicion. Your loyalty—I cannot even
speak of steadily, it is so big and dear—and because it is
so, I shudder to drag you into these forlorn fortunes of
mine. It is in the power of these people to make you
very miserable while I am gone—and that is anguish to
me, nothing less.”</p>

<p>“You think of me—think of me always, and a little
social matter which concerns me!” she exclaimed. “I
care nothing for it—oh, please believe that. Last night
you left the Armory, not knowing what had befallen
you. This morning you know all. Could you have done
unconsciously—anything to turn the Hate of London upon
you?... It is not in reason. I believe it is just
and right for me to know what my father told you in
the night—but you will not tell me——”</p>

<p>“This thing is mine to carry—to carry alone. Last
night I laughed. To-day I find that it is not a thing to
laugh at. The Hate of London,”—Routledge carved out
the words slowly and clearly, in spite of the resistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
of his whole humanity—“I have brought upon myself.”</p>

<p>“Not with dishonor!”</p>

<p>He was silent.</p>

<p>“Not with dishonor, Routledge-san!” she whispered
triumphantly, peering into his eyes. “You could not
convey a falsehood to me, not even to shield another—not
even if you uttered the words of the lie. Your eyes
would tell the truth to me!”</p>

<p>Rain splashed upon the windows of the carriage. The
face so near him in the gloom was like the vision of a
master-artist, too perfect for the poor human hand. The
pressure of her shoulder; the fragrance of her presence;
the voice of her which stirred within him the primal
mystery of other lives—against such he fought for
strength.... It was not passion in the red meaning
of the word, but a love that made the railway gates at
Charing Cross his portals to living death.</p>

<p>“Think what you will,” he commanded, after a
moment. “God knows, I do not want you to think me
devilish, but you must be silent to others about me....
You will make me suffer more than you know—if
you stand against London for me—when I am gone.
It was a magnificent life labor of your father’s which
purchased for you—your place in London....
Noreen Cardinegh, I shall leave the carriage as we
approach Charing Cross; and in the name of God, do
nothing to further attract my infamy to your name!”</p>

<p>“We will say no more about that,” she answered
quietly. “I shall avoid every man and woman in London
who would dare to speak of infamy and Routledge-san in
one breath, but if they seek me out!... But I have
other things to say. You must go, and I must stay.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
Before you go, I shall tell you what you have done for
Noreen Cardinegh, and what you mean to her—to me....
You are my bravest man, Routledge-san....
When I was but a little girl my father told me of you. I
have heard all the men speak of you. Yours would have
been the greatest of all welcomes at the Armory last night—save
for this terrible mystery. I saw the way that little
boy looked up at you this morning. I know what he
thought—for the same thoughts were mine in Japan when
I was but a little older. And your work has been deep
and important to me—a personal, illuminating service.
It has made me see the vanity of piled stones, the futility
of possessions. In looking the way you pointed—I have
found that real life is not food and metal——”</p>

<p>The tension was eased for a moment. Routledge
laughed softly. “Why, I am but a dealer in war-stuff—the
most godless of all matter, Noreen,” he said.</p>

<p>“A dealer in war-stuff—to make the world see the
horrible farce of it! Oh, don’t think I have failed to
see the import of your work, or failed to contrast it with
the ponderous egotism of certain other English war-correspondents,
who build their careers upon wars—with
their dull studies of tactics, their heavy handling of
strategies—so comically like a child panting with heavy
stones. Do you think that I did not see, in spite of your
brilliant description how the Japanese caught and held
the van at Tientsin, the real picture of your whole story—that
of a cruel, ruthless nation of insensate boys—running
to jaw instead of mind?”</p>

<p>Routledge was startled by the expression of a thought
which the <i>Review</i> would not intentionally have published,
less obviously than in a charade. There was nothing of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
vanity in the matter, but her words became dear to
memory—rifts in that dreadful parting hour. Certainly
there was deep gladness for the woman in the telling:</p>

<p>“They speak of you losing yourself in India for
months and months. Do you think I have missed all
that you have found, Routledge-san, when you were lost
to men? I know something of what India means to you,
her submission and her famines, and the hundreds of
little Warren Hastings’ trooping over her, from Lahore
to Pondicherry, brooding of pounds and power! Why,
to me you have placed it clear as Carlyle with his reverberating
thunders of fifty years ago. Here is England,
sitting dull-eyed among her flesh-pots, and yonder is
India—drained. You did not say it in direct words,
Routledge-san, but you made me see the provinces of
India scattered about like the shells of insects in a spider’s
web, and this London—the darkened lair of the watching
eyes.... Oh, I have seen all that you mean,
Routledge-san, but more—the bigger, finer things than
national relations.... You have gone into the
silent places to meditate, and to me you have brought
back the images of the silence—big, chaste things, like
our bravest man. There is good and there is hope in the
world which holds such men and such things—and
because of you I have kept my optimism. I seem to have
a perfect torrent of talk, but I have been so much alone
to think—and you are going away. I want you to know
that you and the things you have brought to me are
bigger—than London and the world.... When I
speak with you—I seem to have known you always....
And then you are going away—with a burden in
your heart, which no act of yours put there....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
Why is it, Routledge-san, that one’s bravest man must
suffer such deluges of evil?”</p>

<p>“Noreen, you are resistless,” he murmured. “It is
life——”</p>

<p>She pressed her face to the pane, tried thoughtlessly
to brush away the blurring rain on the outside. With a
quick, savage return of pain, she realized how near they
were to Charing Cross.</p>

<p>“I haven’t told you—all that I mean yet, Routledge-san!”
she whispered feverishly. “You met some adversary
last night and conquered. You are weak and hurt—but
you have won.... I cannot quite understand,
but the sentence ringing in my brain is this: ‘The young
grain is springing on the field of Waterloo.’... I
met my adversary in the night—and I have won, too.
When I think of you—it rushes over me like a tidal wave—to
fight London and the world for you; but I have my
work here. It must be done cleanly and without a cry.
My father needs me. The best is gone from him already—and
I must treasure the rest; but it will not be always....
And when my work is finished in Cheer Street,
Routledge-san, I shall cross the world to find you!”</p>

<p>He felt it hard to breathe in the desolation. A desire
full-formed and upstanding, in spite of the mockery of it,
vanquished him for a moment. It was to keep on with
her—riding, journeying, sailing—with her, through the
gates of Charing Cross, to Southampton, New York, San
Francisco, Yokohama, Nagasaki, Shanghai, Hong Kong,
Singapore, Calcutta—up the Ganges to its source in the
Hills, and there among the mystic people of his heart, to
dwell with her, adoring in the stillness of starlight, in the
morning glow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>“I shall be nameless, and a wanderer——”</p>

<p>“And my bravest man!... This is not unwomanly,
Routledge-san. This is farewell. The girl is
torn from me—and the woman speaks her heart....
No one but you could understand. Always I have been
strange.... I cannot leave it unsaid. I shall come
to find you when I am free! It is not—not that I shall
ask you to marry me. It is not that—but to be with
you! I think—I think that you are so noble that my
being a woman would not complicate.... Routledge-san!
It is Charing Cross!”</p>

<p>Swiftly she drew tiny scissors from a pocket-case,
snipped from her temple a lock of hair, tied it with a
strand of its own, and thrust it into his hand.</p>

<p>It was light, living, warm like a bird in his palm.
Her last words intoned through his dreams for many
days:</p>

<p>“Remember, I am Noreen Cardinegh—who believes
in you always—before all men—for all time. And I,
too, must be brave and enduring until my work is done—and
I may cross the world to find you!”</p>

<p>... He was standing at the curb before the great
station. The carriage had turned away. There came to
him out of the throng—a cry, not to his ears, but straight
to his breast, a cry wild with desolation, which his heart
answered....</p>

<p>He purchased his ticket, and rechecked his baggage,
and then passed through the gates to the gray, smoky
yards. From the deck of his steamer at Southampton
that night he caught a last glimpse of the White Mustache,
a satisfied smile on the keen, hard face. In a cold,
distant fashion, Routledge marvelled that he was allowed
to leave England alive.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">NINTH CHAPTER<br>

<small>MR. JASPER IS INFORMED THAT MOTHER INDIA
CAUSED NAPOLEON’S DEFEAT, AND THAT
FAMINES ARE NOT WITHOUT VIRTUE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">J. J. Jasper</span>, Syracuse, New York,” was being
inscribed in the hotel registers along the travelled-lines
around the world. Mr. Jasper was making no haste.
“I have been rushed all my life until now,” he explained.
He was a sincere, hard-thinking, little man of fifty, who
had manufactured road-carts for thirty years, and had
succeeded remarkably well in emancipating himself from
business—a high-ranged achievement for only the few
Americans.</p>

<p>Mr. Jasper was interested in India long before he
touched Bombay, going east. This happened because his
sister was a member of a theosophical class back in
Syracuse. He had heard of “dreamy India” for many
years, of Madras and the Ganges, of <i>yogis</i> and astral
bodies, of esoteric sections and H.P.B., of Sinnett, Olcott,
Besant, masters, famines, of <i>karma</i>, <i>devachan</i>, <i>pralaya</i>,
of metempsychosis and the Great White Lodge of the
Himalayas.... “Go to Madras, James,” his sister
had told him. “By all means, go to Madras. Our
headquarters and our libraries of occult literature are
there. It may be that our president and founder, Mr.
Olcott, will meet you personally, or Annie Besant, the
most noted woman in the world. Don’t call it ‘Bes<i>ant</i>’,
like the author, but as if it were spelled ‘<i>Bes</i>sant.’ There
are reasons, James, <i>esoteric reasons</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>And so Mr. Jasper went to Madras. He took the
hand of white-bearded Olcott,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> a rounded man, who had
not lost interest in the New York bar or press simply
because he was president and founder of a great body of
generally refined men and women who have the temerity
to believe that buying cheap and selling dear is not the
supreme glory of man. Also Mr. Jasper pronounced
it “<i>Bes</i>sant,” for esoteric reasons, but he did not meet
the most noted woman in the world, since she had taken
her annual flight to London.</p>

<p>In the midst of all his seeing and smelling and brooding
among the coast cities of India, Mr. Jasper was
impressed with the dire poverty of certain districts. The
heart of the man was wrung, and his brain filled with the
Everlasting Why. At the house of a missionary in
Nizagari, he ascertained certain facts. The Hindus of
the town were hungry. They came to the missionary,
men and wives and babes, and begged most pitifully for
food.</p>

<p>“If we could only eat food once in two days, we
would ask no more!” they cried.</p>

<p>“God, this is famine—the famine of the Bible!” exclaimed
the American.</p>

<p>“Ah, no,” replied the missionary. “You must allow
me to correct you. There is no <i>recognized</i> famine in
Nizagari.”</p>

<p>“If this is not famine—what does the word mean?”</p>

<p>“Go to the central provinces,” the missionary said
wearily. “Famine is declared there.”</p>

<p>Mr. Jasper thought long that night. He recalled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
being left once, when he was a much younger man, in
New York city over night without money. The metropolis
was a city of strangers to him then, but, as now, a
city of pure and plenteous water, free lunches, and
benches to sit upon. Moreover, it was a summer night;
and yet before mail-time in the morning, Mr. Jasper felt
that his cosmos had dropped into chaos.... “I
will arise and go to the Central Provinces,” he declared.
After many weary days, he alighted from his train in the
hot, fetid city of Nagpur.</p>

<p>“Famine,” they told him—he thought he saw famine
in the eyes of the English—“yes, there is famine northward,
but the government has taken it in hand. You see,
when a famine is officially declared it doesn’t last
long....”</p>

<p>Mr. Jasper hurried northward, lest it be over before
he reached there. He wanted to see the conditions which
would cause the Anglo-Indians officially to recognize
famine. Finally, it was borne upon him that he must
leave the railway to discover the reality, and he made his
way eastward, for a long day’s journey, by bullock-cart
and sedan-chair, across a burning, forsaken land to the
town of Rydamphur—too little and too far for the
English yet to have heard its cry. Least of villages,
Rydamphur, a still, sterile, Christless place, sprawled
upon a saffron desert. He paid his coolies at the edge
of the village, and they pointed out the Rest House among
the huts.</p>

<p>The place was dead as a dream creation. There was
something febrile, unnatural in the late afternoon sunlight.
The houses looked withered and ready to fall in
that dead-gold light. He passed a darkened doorway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
and was stabbed by the spur of horrid understanding—a
blast of unutterable fetor.... He ran for a step or
two, horrified as if he had trodden upon the dead in the
dark. His brain was filled with muttering: “This is
famine! This is famine!”... Mr. Jasper turned
shortly, and saw emerging from the darkened hut—a
white man in native dress. It was a face incapable of
tan, and fixed with a sorrow too deep for tears—a wild,
tragic sorrow, vivid in the fever-wide eyes....</p>

<p>It was all nightmarish and inchoate. Thus he entered
the oven of bricks called the Rest House, and bathed,
changed, and gasped, while the snoring punkahs whipped
him with hot, sterilizing breaths.... Dinner that
evening at eight. Mr. Jasper sat down to a table with
a gaunt, embrowned stranger in white linen—a wasted
giant, with a head and figure of singular command; eyes
that were weary and restless, but very wise and very
kind. So sun-darkened was the face that Mr. Jasper
thought at first his companion must be a native of high
caste; especially since he ate no meat and sparingly of
the rest. The dinner was meagre, but a feast compared to
what was expected in the nucleus of a famine district.</p>

<p>“I didn’t suppose such a variety of food could be procured
here,” Mr. Jasper observed.</p>

<p>“There has been plenty of food to be had for money,
until the last day or two,” the stranger replied.</p>

<p>“And the natives have no money?”</p>

<p>Mr. Jasper realized that the question was inane, but
his eagerness was great to draw the man before him into
conversation. There was a distinguished look in the
man’s face which promised much. He proved by no
means disinclined to talk; indeed, seemed urged by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
strange zeal for conversation that night, as one who has
been in prison, or somewhere long and far from his kind.</p>

<p>“I came here, not out of vulgar curiosity, but striving
to understand,” Mr. Jasper said.</p>

<p>“And how do you like our great brown Mother
India?”</p>

<p>“She does not feed her children.”</p>

<p>“That is true. Mother India must come back to the
table of the world and learn how things are served by
the younger peoples—the sharper-eyed, quicker-handed
peoples. You have heard the story, no doubt, that India
had once great and profitable industries. Her commercial
systems were founded upon mutual service, not upon competition.
Then the East India company and England
came. ‘Mother India, you are quite absurd,’ said England,
and she took away all the mutual benefit industries,
and reorganized them again in the true English way.
‘We shall show you how, Mother India,’ she said. India
must have been inept, because England never gave them
back.”</p>

<p>Both men were smiling. “Then you think India
famines are the result of British rule?” the man from
Syracuse observed.</p>

<p>“If I told you that, it would be right for me to explain
why I think so. That would take some time, and the
night is very hot.”</p>

<p>“I came to Rydamphur to learn the truth. Somehow,
I believe I shall succeed—if you will tell me what
you can, sir.” The stranger’s eyes brightened.</p>

<p>“Discussing the matter seriously, it is well to begin
with Macaulay’s sentence. ‘The heaviest of all yokes is
the yoke of a stranger.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“You are not an Englishman?” Mr. Jasper asked.</p>

<p>“No, but does that signify? Many English have
spoken the truth. Edmund Burke said, ‘The Tartar
invasion was mischievous, but it is our protection which
destroys India.’ The English historian, Montgomery
Martin, wrote that so constant a drain as England’s upon
India would impoverish England herself if she were subjected
to it. And here reflect that the wage of the laborer,
when he gets work, averages but twopence a day.
J. I. Sunderland observes, ‘The British have <i>given</i> India
railways, jute-mills, tea plantations, and many things
else.... The profits go to the British.’ Mr.
Sunderland, no doubt, remarks elsewhere about the opium
industry. Herbert Spencer declares that it was an arrogant
assumption upon the part of the British to accept as
a fact that India exists for England. He also characterizes
England’s relations to India as a ‘cunning despotism
which uses native soldiers to maintain and extend
native subjection.’”</p>

<p>“But we in America,” said Mr. Jasper—“I refer to
those who have not looked deeply into the question—even
our president, Mr. Roosevelt—have regarded English
rule in India as a vast and beneficent system.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” responded the stranger, with a queer
smile; “as you say, those who have not looked deeply
into the question, regard it so. There was another
American president, Mr. Lincoln, who declared that no
man is good enough to govern another man....
But there are errors of judgment all around the world,
and errors of ignorance which make for cruelty. English
agents will come here to poor little Rydamphur
presently with rice and millet, and when the rains start,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
the periodic famine officially will be declared over for
another year, and the people of this district will arise to
the normal condition of forty millions of India—that
of slow starvation.”</p>

<p>“But why don’t the Hindus emigrate?”</p>

<p>“Mother India cannot afford to give her children
passage money,” the stranger declared quickly. “She
is sending a few, the pith and promise of her young men,
to America and elsewhere to learn from the younger
peoples how to take care of herself in commercial matters,
in the hope of reviving her industries in centuries to
come. But the ordinary low-castes, <i>the fuel of the famines</i>,
would have to starve a little extra in good times to save
from their earnings the price to cross one of our North
River ferries. They would die long before they hoarded
the fare from Brooklyn Bridge to Coney Island.”</p>

<p>Mr. Jasper’s eyes kindled at the references. “But
why do the Hindus not fight?” he asked.</p>

<p>“India has no arms.”</p>

<p>“But even our little South and Central American
States get arms and fight right merrily with them.”</p>

<p>“India is poorer than the little South and Central
American States—so poor that it requires a white man
years to conceive the meaning of her poverty.” The
speaker leaned forward and added in a slow, bitter way:
“Forty millions in India are hungry to-night: forty
millions are never otherwise than hungry—they pass
from the womb to the burning-ghats, never having known
a moment of repletion: yet England drains India of one
hundred million dollars a year. Listen; in the last
twenty-five years of the nineteenth century ten millions
in India died of famine. In the same period England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
vampirized this land of the hungry of twenty-five hundred
millions of dollars. This is one of the tragic facts of the
world.</p>

<p>“Here’s another: in the nineteenth century England
compelled India to maintain five times as many troops as
were needed for her own defense or her own <i>subjection</i>—in
other words, forced India to furnish troops for British
conquests outside of India!... Would you mind,
sir, if I uttered a sentence that has never been uttered
before?”</p>

<p>Mr. Jasper laughed a little nervously.</p>

<p>“It was India that whipped Napoleon.”</p>

<p>“There’s some shock to that statement. Tell me
how.”</p>

<p>“In the fifty-seven years between the battles of
Plassey and Waterloo, England looted a billion in pounds
sterling—five thousand million dollars—from the conquered
Indian people. This was the price India paid for
bondage, for ruined industries and periodic famines.
This was the period of England’s military expansion.
The army that crushed Napoleon was fed and clothed
and armed by Indian tributes.”</p>

<p>Neither spoke for a moment, and the stranger added
with an impressiveness that Mr. Jasper never forgot:
“It is rather stirring to remember that this old India
was highly civilized, in a rich meaning of the expression,
ripe in arts, letters, and incomparable philosophies, when
the ancestors of the English were painted savages. India
was the leader of Asiatic civilization, and perhaps the
richest country in the world, when England broke in upon
her. What is old India now? Hearken to the souls passing
in little Rydamphur to-night!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“But what, in God’s name, can be done?” Mr. Jasper
demanded.</p>

<p>“When England begins to treat India as she would
be forced to treat a colony of white men, aggressive as
Americans, for instance, India will begin to discover her
gray of morning.”</p>

<p>“But England won’t do that until India becomes a
militant people.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m afraid not. England still has much of her
imperialistic arrogance.... A little while ago, one
of the ablest of the native editors, an old man, was banished
from the country for six years because he published
an article in his paper pointing out his country’s misfortunes.
This aged editor was a Murahti, and during
his trial called for a Murahti jury. On the contrary, the
jury was made of English and Parsees. The prisoner
did not know a word of the court’s proceedings until an
interpreter informed him of his banishment. Another
young Hindu nobleman was recently banished for life
because he took part in public speeches. The English
judge who sentenced this young man declared that there
was no reason for one Hindu addressing a gathering of
Hindus, since the latter had no votes. I call that a rather
interesting political homily.”</p>

<p>“It is chief among outrages,” declared Mr. Jasper.</p>

<p>The other regarded him intently a moment, as if
deliberating whether it were wise to go a bit farther. He
studied the deep and honest interest in the perspiring
face, and caught up the question afresh:</p>

<p>“India, the best of India, has lost from her blood that
which makes for war and commercial conquests. She
is the longest suffering of all the nations. She asks only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
for peace. Those great playthings of the more material
powers—navies, soldiery, colonies, armament—she cannot
appreciate, cannot understand. India is not cowardly.
You would not call an old man a coward because he
rebukes with a smile a young brute who has struck him.
Old mystic India prefers to starve rather than to outrage
her philosophy with war. She has even adjusted her
philosophy to the spectacle of her children starving,
rather than to descend to the outgrown ugliness of physical
warfare. It has been work of mine to study the
nations somewhat, and I have come to think of them as
human beings at different ages.... Look at young
Japan—the sixteen-year-old among the powers! A
brown-skinned, black-eyed boy, cruel, unlit from within,
formidable, and itching to use again the strength he has
once felt. To the boy-brain, supremacy at war is the
highest victory the world can give. Japan has the health
of a boy, heals like an earth-worm, and blazes with pride
in the possession of his first weapons. Like the boy again,
he is blind to the intrinsic rights of women. Shamelessly,
he casts his women out over the seven seas to fill the
brothels of every port—breeds human cattle to feed the
world’s lusts, and knows no prick of pride—but watch
him run hot-breathed to the rifle-pits if so much as a
bit of humor from an outside nation stirs the restless
chip upon his shoulder! Brute boy, Japan, the trophies
of conquests are as yet but incidents to him. The soldier
is in highest manifestation; the expansionist not yet
weaned. He fights for the great glory of the fight—mad
with the direct and awful lust of standing in the midst
of the fallen....</p>

<p>“America?... Yes, I am an American.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
America is thirty-five, as I see her, and her passion is
for the symbol of conquest, Dollars. America is self-tranced
by looking into money, as those who gaze at
crystal. The dollar-toxin riots in her veins. All the
corrosion of the cursed Hebraic propensity for the concrete,
appears to be the heritage of America. She is
amassing as men never amassed before. She is lean from
garnering, so terrifically beset with multiples and divisors
that she has not even learned the material usages of
money—how to spend gracefully. One night an American
is a profligate prince; the next day a scheming,
ravening, fish-blooded money-changer to pay for it. So
busy is America collecting the symbols of possession, that
she has little time to turn her thoughts to war, though
she has by no means yet lost her physical condition.
Having whipped England once, and purged herself with
an internecine struggle, America now believes that she
has only to drop her ticker, her groceries, and her paper
continents, snatch up the rifle and cartridge-belt—to whip
the world. Just a case of necessity, you know, and
Grants and Lees and Lincolns will arise; labor turn into
militia, and the land a sounding-board of trampling invincibles.
But war is not the real expression of America
in this young century. Financial precedence over one’s
neighbor, vulgar outward flaunts of opulence, lights,
noise, glitter, show—these are the forms of expression in
vogue—concrete evidences of a more or less concrete
accumulation. The excesses of America are momentary
in contrast to the steady glut-glut of big-belted Europe.
Of her glory I do not speak, of her humor, her inventions.
It is this low present propensity—that is hard to
bear. So rich still are America’s national resources that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
she has found no need of an India yet. May she put on
wisdom and sweetness while the evil days come not—God
bless her!...</p>

<p>“Look at England—fat and fifty, overfed, short of
breath, thickening in girth, deepening in brain. England
building her ships to fatten in peace; talking much of
war to keep the peace, but far beyond the zest and stir of
trumpets. England, entered upon her inevitable period of
physical decadence, boasting of conquests, like a middle-aged
man with rheum in his eye, the clog of senility under
his waist-coat, stiffness in his joints, and the red lights of
apoplexy bright upon his throat—who throws out his
chest among his sons and pants that he is ‘better than
ever, e’gad!’ England, sensuous in the home, crowding
her houses like a squirrel’s nest in the frosts; an animated
stomach, already cultivating and condimenting her fitful
but necessary appetites; wise and crafty in the world,
but purblind to her own perversions and lying in the rot
of them.... England, who will not put away
boyish things and look to God!... She is draining
India as Rome drained Gaul, as Spain drained Mexico,
and accelerating the bestiality which spells <i>ruin</i>—with the
spoils.... What a sweet and perfect retaliation if
Gaul could only have seen the monstrous offspring of
the Cæsars; if the Aztecs had only endured to see what
befell Spain after the <i>Noche Triste</i>; if India—but did
not India point out in her philosophy the wages of
national, vampirism—before Cortez and before the
Cæsars?</p>

<p>“Then, if I am not wearying you, we might look at
Russia, sundering in the pangs of wretched age. Mad,
lesioned, its body a parliament of pains, its brain vaporing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
of past glories in its present ghastliness of disintegration.</p>

<p>“And India, I see a difference here. All men as all
nations must suffer. Europe and America are learning to
suffer through their excesses; India through her privations,
a cleaner, holier way.... I think of India as
an old widow who has given away her possessions to a
litter of Gonerils and Absaloms—put away all the vanities
of conquest and material possessions—a poor old widow
with gaunt breasts and palsied hands, who asks only a
seat in the chimney-corner, and crumbs from the table
of the world!... She has still kept a smile of
kindliness for the world, as she sits in the gloom, her
soul lifting to the stars....</p>

<p>“After all, famine blinds us, because we are here
in the midst of it. It is hard to restrain one’s rebellion
in the midst of Rydamphur’s dead, when one thinks
that the Englishman spends for intoxicating drinks
annually two-and-one-half-times what the Hindu individual
spends for food, drink, fuel, clothing, medicine,
recreation, education, and religion. It horrifies us little
to think that at home they are spending on roaring
Broadway, this very night, in dines and wines and steins,
and kindred vanities and viciousness, enough to keep a
million native mothers in milk for their babes a fortnight.
If we could sit away up in the Hills so that all the world
were in its proper relation and perspective, we might perceive
something sanitive and less sodden in starvation,
something less pestilential than the death of drink and
gluttony. You know the soul burns bright at the end
of much fasting.”</p>

<p>The tall stranger had spoken mildly in the main, as if
discussing matters of food before him. Only occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
he leaned forward, his eyes lit with prophecy or rebellion.
Mr. Jasper felt the animation of the other’s presence
most remarkably. He had never met such a man, and
said so with boyish impulsiveness.</p>

<p>The other regarded him with genuine gratitude. “I
was afraid that I had spoken too freely. One is inclined
to be fluent in the thing he knows well. I do not mean
to say that I know India, but only that I have studied
India long. She has many facets, and at best one’s views
are but one’s own.”</p>

<p>Mr. Jasper offered his card.</p>

<p>“I thank you,” said the stranger. “I am not carrying
cards just now. My name matters little to any one,
but I wish you a very good night.”</p>

<p>The Syracuse manufacturer went to his room and sat
in the dark under the punkahs, staring out the window and
studying what he had heard. The saffron desert was
ghostly gray under the brilliant low-hanging stars, and
all objects were black and blotchy upon it. It made him
think of paintings of Egyptian nights—paintings hung
he could not remember where. He was troubled because
the stranger withheld his name. Here was a man with
whom he would have rejoiced to travel, to know
better and better. The thought which recurred strongest
out of all that he had heard was: “<i>All men, as all nations,
must suffer.</i> Europe and America are learning to suffer
through their excesses; India through her privations, a
cleaner, holier way.”</p>

<p>The drone of the punkah-leathers ruffled his very good
nerves at last, and Mr. Jasper went out to walk. In a
little hut at the far end of the street, to which he was
attracted by candle-light and the voices of white men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
he perceived three figures through the open doorway.
One was an ancient Hindu, sitting with bowed head upon
the matting. The second was a white man in native
dress, whom he had seen emerging from the hut of
horrors in the afternoon—the face incapable of tan and
vivid with tragic sorrow. The third was the sun-darkened
young giant who had left him earlier in the evening,
who had spoken of India and of her famines, and discussed
the Powers as familiarly as one might discuss his
partners or rivals in business. Quite inadvertently, Mr.
Jasper heard the name which had been withheld from
him by its owner—the name of Routledge.... The
next day he mentioned this name to the Englishman of
the Famine Relief, who had brought provisions to little
Rydamphur. He discovered that it was a name to uncover
devils.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TENTH CHAPTER<br>

<small>A SINGULAR POWER IS MANIFEST IN THE LITTLE
HUT AT RYDAMPHUR, AND ROUTLEDGE PERCEIVES
HIS WORK IN ANOTHER WAR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> the Rest House, Routledge walked in the
mingled gray and shadow to the hut of the candle-light,
where Mr. Jasper afterward saw him. He entered softly.
The aged Hindu sat cross-legged upon a mat of rice
straw, his eyelids closed as if by effort, his lips and entire
chest moving with the Name. This was Sekar, the
master who had come down from the goodly mountains
for his <i>chela</i>—the bravest man. Rawder was lying full-length
upon the floor, his head raised over an open book,
upon which the light shone. He held up his hand to
Routledge, and a glad smile formed on the deep-lined,
pallid face.</p>

<p>“Sit down in the cool of the doorway, and let us talk,
my good friend. What has the day brought you?”</p>

<p>Routledge obeyed, amused at “the cool of the doorway.”
The night breeze was but a withering breath
from the hot sand.</p>

<p>“The day has brought sundry brown babes, and I
have dutifully squeezed a milky rag into their open
mouths. Also, I bought the last rice which the Chunder
person who keeps the Rest House will sell at any price,
and passed it out to the edges of the hunger. The morning
will bring us more dead. What a gruesome monotony
it is—dying, dying, dying—and they make so little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
noise about it. Also, I was so oppressed with famine that
I found a good, unobtrusive American and crowded him
with facts for an hour—a countryman of ours, Rawder.”</p>

<p>“A countryman of ours,” Rawder repeated softly.
“It is long since I have heard the sound of a thought
like that. I am not to see my country again, good
brother.”</p>

<p>“Then, has Sekar told you what you are to do?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We travel to-night northward. The English
will be here to-morrow with grain, so that our work is
done in Rydamphur. You will stay here until to-morrow,
as you said, and then return westward to the railroad,
when the English come.”</p>

<p>“Are you permitted to tell me all that he said?”
Routledge asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. To-night at dusk, Sekar stirred from his
meditations and we spoke together long. I told him that
you meant my whole race to me; that you were dearer to
me than any human being I had ever known. I asked
if he would permit you to travel with us a little longer.
He shook his head. There is much for you still to do in
the world. He said that you would begin to find your
work as soon as you reached travelled-lines. I told
him that your life was in danger where the English
were many; that your life had been attempted in Madras,
and that it was a heavy sorrow for me to part with you so
soon. I asked him if your work in the world were absolute—if
it would not be good for your soul to travel
slowly to the Hills, doing what we found to do on the
way. Sekar shook his head.... Ah, Routledge,
my brother, there is to be another war for you. There
will come a day in which you will know a great need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
for human aid, and it will not be given me to come to
you—but another—a woman!”</p>

<p>Rawder’s voice trembled. Routledge never forgot
the moment. The restless, writhing flame of the candle,
straining as if for more vital air; little Rydamphur, out
of the ken of the world, and death moving from hut to
hut; the still, dreadful Indian night; the ancient mystic,
tranced in meditation, so emaciated with years and asceticism
that each added breath seemed a dispensation; the
white face of Rawder, which had long since been graven
with beautiful meanings for his friend; the eyes of
Rawder, which had never been defiled by hate or rage or
lust, so radiant with sorrow now; and the revelations on
Rawder’s lips, which half the human family is still so
young as to have called madness.</p>

<p>“He is right,” said Routledge. “It is the law.
You have naught to do with human attachments on the
way to the Hills. And I am to follow the fortunes of
another war?”</p>

<p>“Such a war as never has been——”</p>

<p>“In Asia?”</p>

<p>“Yes. In the north—beyond the mountains. He
did not say more, but you are soon to know. God pity
you, Routledge! How gladly would I take the travail
from you! You are to fall—not among the piled dead,
not in the thundering centres of battle, but apart....
You are to live. He promised me that you would not
die, and that another, a woman, would come to help you.
I know you are to live, because it is written that once
more in this life I am to take your hand.”</p>

<p>“Just once more?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“Did he tell you where?”</p>

<p>Rawder bowed his head. His fingers trembled upon
his knee.</p>

<p>“In the Leper Valley,” he said.</p>

<p>“Must you still go to the Leper Valley?”</p>

<p>“It is there I am to meet that which you once called
‘The Dweller of the Threshold,’” Rawder said.</p>

<p>In the silence of a moment the men regarded each
other. From the ancient Hindu came the majestic Name,
intoned as from a sea-beaten cavern—deep, distant, portentous.
The <i>chela</i> bowed in spirit, closing his eyes.
Routledge was lost to the world for an instant—hung
breathless in space, as if the world were flinging back
from him like a receding wave.</p>

<p>“I was hoping that Sekar would not always lead you
through the slums and hells of the world, Rawder,”
Routledge said at last. “You caught full in the face all
the perfected venoms of a New England country town,
even to the persecutions of your church. You had to
learn Boston under the flare of the torch. The grisly
humor of American troops was your portion in the
cavalry, and godless Minday your first mission. Hong
Kong gave you her loathsome water-front to sweep, and
you were all but murdered there, as in Minday. India
has led you into the midst of her plagues and famines.
You have toiled in the forefront of her misery. No brow
has been too degraded by disease for your hand to cool;
no death has been so triumphant that you would not bend
to cover it. I thought at the last you might taste just
a morsel, perhaps, of the beauty and sweetness of things,
before you were lost to us beyond the Hills....
Instead, you go to the Leper Valley.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>Rawder regarded him with a grateful smile, in which
there was wonderment that his friend should have
remembered all this, but he spoke with gentle remonstrance,
“My little services have been for the least of
men because they needed them most. It did not happen
that way; it was intended so. From the beginning, the
only men who would listen to me were those humbled by
great pain, or lost in great darkness. I do not understand
even now why I should have earned the boon
of a Master to abide with me. Yet he has come—and
I am the happiest of men. The Leper Valley—that is
but a halt on heaven’s highway.... I am the
happiest of men, Routledge, my brother, yet the mightiest
pain of my life has fallen upon me——”</p>

<p>Rawder went to the door and stood silent for several
moments; then turned back to the light, his face calmer.</p>

<p>“I have loved you strongly, Routledge. You have
been to me—the representative man. I have never known
the touch of a woman’s hand, nor the eye of a woman—but
for you I have felt all the great love of a man for a
man. To-night, before you came, Sekar told me that only
once again in this life I am to see you. It is to be after
my trial in the Leper Valley. After that, I am to put
away all love for you in the flesh, since it binds me to
the Wheel.... This is harder for me than many
Mindays, harder than service through interminable
famines, harder than blows and revilings from multitudes
of men, harder than any trial in the Leper Valley. To
think that you must descend again into battle—you who
know so well the awful sin of war—that I should have
a fore-knowledge of you being maimed in the body, and
to be unable to go to you—ah, nothing that I must face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
in the Leper Valley can haunt and torture the soul of
your friend like this.”</p>

<p>The half had never been told before. Routledge
bowed before the great devotion of this simplest and
holiest man the world had shown him. In a swift gesture
Rawder’s hand had passed between the eyes of the
correspondent and the candle-flame. Fragile, trembling,
almost transparent, it was eloquent with a beauty
Routledge had never noted before. Within himself
great changes were enacting.</p>

<p>There was <i>power</i> in that little Rydamphur hut, power
from the hidden wells of creation. It was made clear to
him what force had impelled Sekar to find his <i>chela</i>.
There was karma still for the ancient Hindu to work out,
since he dragged his weary, grave-hungering flesh down
from the peace and purity of his mountains to the burning
plains of men—to take back this whitest soul of the
Occident.</p>

<p>“Rawder,” Routledge said slowly, reverently, “It
has long been a big part of my understanding—what you
mean to me. I once told a lady of you—of my bravest
man—and this lady watches and listens for you across
the world. That I go back into battle again is quite right
and inevitable. I have not yet reached Mother Earth’s
graduating class. The wound which you foretell is nothing.
It is good that I am to see you once more—even
in the Leper Valley—though it holds you longer than I
thought from the rest you have earned. As for parting,
you know better than I that the word has no meaning.
You know better than I that the relations between master
and disciple do not end with the body, nor the relations
of friend and friend. There never has lived a pure great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
soul, who has not glimpsed what means the emancipation
from the flesh, and discerned in his high moments
such joys that the strength of his soul was sternly tried
in the effort to live out his allotted days. If such glimpses
were given to all men, the nations would suffer from a
shock of suicide such as no war nor famine ever wrought.</p>

<p>“We will both go gladly to our work. I see my
mission clearly to-night. It is to scoff at war before men;
to show what a monstrous activity it is for <i>men</i>; to show
how black is the magic of the ambitious few, who dare
to make cannon-meat of God’s multitudes. I, the watcher
of many services, who am supposed to bow before the
battle-lines, and carve my career from their triumphs and
defeats, shall laugh at their untimely and ridiculous
manifestations. At the last, I shall paint war so red, so
real, in all its ghastly, abortive reality, that the nations
shall shudder—as at the towering crime on Calvary—shudder
to the quick of their souls, and sin no more!”</p>

<p>The moment was exalted. Something vaster, nobler,
than mere human consciousness expanded within
Routledge.... He saw the pitiful pawns thronging
to fill the legions of Cæsar, who stooped to learn the
names of certain of his centurions. He saw that black
plague, Napoleon, and the regiments herding for slaughter
under his glaring, spike-pointed eye; great masses of
God-loved men vying to die swiftly at a word from that
iron-rimmed cavern of desolation, Napoleon’s mouth—the
mouth which deigned to utter from time to time the
names of chiefs he counted upon presently to murder.
Cæsar and Napoleon, incarnates of devilish ambition,
mastodons of licensed crime, towering epileptics both....
He hungered for the time when the world would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
learn to bottle such admirable concentrates of hell-poison
before they shamed humanity by driving poor group-souled
masses first mad and then into the ignoble death
of war.</p>

<p>“It has been a high night to me, Rawder,” Routledge
said. “I am proud to thank you for showing me my
work. And I can see yours on and on—even to the
Leper Valley.... Strange, Rawder, but there is
a picture with it, in my mind—a picture that has always
come to me in high, hard moments.... Nightfall—a land
of hills and heat, and a dusty, winding highway.
The Christ passes in the midst of a throng. He is weary,
athirst, and hungering. The empty voices of the crowd
bind His thoughts to misery. The pitiful ways of men
have put a martyrdom of sadness in His heart. At length
above the whispering of feet on the warm sand, above
the Babel of the followers, comes to His ear alone a moan
from the darkness. It thrills with agony. He leaves the
highway. The throng understands. They pull at His
garments and cry, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’ Even the leper
lying in the darkness warns Him, ‘Unclean!’ as is the
law.... But the beautiful Christ bends with the
touch of healing!...</p>

<p>“I shall come to find you in the Leper Valley, my
bravest man. And you shall go on after that to the
great peace that is ‘mortised and tenoned’ in the granite
of the Hills!... But, Rawder, you shall look back
out of the glorious amplitude beyond the Leper Valley
to find at last that your friend is nearly ready. Perhaps
you will come for him—even as Sekar came for you.”</p>

<p>With a quick intaking of breath, the material consciousness
of the Hindu returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“It is the hour,” he said to his <i>chela</i>. “We travel in
the night.”</p>

<p>Again the fleeting look of agony across the white
face of Rawder, but Routledge gripped his shoulder, and
spoke to Sekar:</p>

<p>“It is a little thing, but I have plenty of money, if
you need it. Would you not travel—at least, out of the
region of great heat—in the fire-carriages of the English?
A fortnight’s journey each daylight?”</p>

<p>The Sannyasi answered: “The beloved of my disciple
has earned many favors. It has been made clear
to me that we must travel alone and on foot. I am very
old, but there is still strength for the journey—or I
should not have been sent.”</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand—it was like a charred
branch—and Routledge bent his head for the blessing.</p>

<p>“You have chosen well, beloved of my <i>chela</i>. It is
the shorter, steeper way you tread. This life you have
dedicated to the service of men, and you are bound to the
Wheel by the love of woman. Fulfil the duties all, and
the way shall be quickened. Once more our paths shall
meet—and there shall be four—in the Leper Valley!”</p>

<p>Rawder poured a cup of water upon the aged feet,
dried them with a cloth, and drew the sandals firm.</p>

<p>“Night and morning I shall send you my blessing,
Routledge, my brother,” he said, standing near the door.
“Morning and evening, until we meet again in the Leper
Valley, you shall know that there is a heart that thrills
for the good of your life and your soul. Good-by.”</p>

<small>A HAND TOUCHES THE SLEEVE OF THE GREAT FRIEZE
COAT IN THE WINTRY TWILIGHT ON
THE BUND AT SHANGHAI</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Routledge</span> sat long in meditation after Rawder and
his master had taken up their journey. Time passed
unmeasured over his head until he was aroused by the
guttering of a candle-wick. In quite an un-American
fashion, he believed the prophetic utterances which the
night had brought. The more a man knows, the more
he will believe. The mark of a small man is ever his
incapacity to accept that which he cannot hold in continual
sight. Still, Routledge endured a reaction for the
high moments of the recent hour. Sekar and Rawder
and the power were gone from Rydamphur. He even
felt abashed because of his outbursts to Rawder, so
long had he been accustomed to the iron control of his
emotions. It was not that he was sorry for what he had
said, but torrential utterance leaves depletion. He did
not feel the strength now to make men laugh at wars,
nor to stay the tide of the world’s wars by painting the
volcanic wrath of nations in all its futile and ferocious
significance.</p>

<p>That he was to be hurt in the new war was in itself
but a vague anxiety, dull of consideration except for its
relation to the foretelling—that another was to come to
help him!... He wondered if the wound would
come from his enemies. Once before, a night in Madras,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
as he was entering a house of hiding a noose of leather
dropped upon his shoulder. It was jerked tight with a
sinister twang. Routledge had just escaped the garrote
in the dark. He could not always escape; and yet he was
not to die next time. Rawder said: ... “To fall
wounded, apart from the battle-field, to lie helplessly
regarding men and events from the fallen state, instead
of face to face—this was but one of the tossing tragedies
of cloud in his mind. Yet there was a radiant light in
the midst of it all—only one woman in the world’s half-billion
would come to him.”</p>

<p>Any suffering was cheap to prevent her coming—but
he could not prevent! One cannot run from a vision
or a prophecy. It is well to obey when one is ordered up
into Nineveh. Even Sekar had cast him off, because he
was a counter-attraction to the soul of Rawder. He
could not forswear war—and so avoid the promised
wound, which would enable her to find him—since he was
not to meet the levelling stroke during a collision of
troops, but somewhere apart. It was a chain of circumstances
in which he was absolutely powerless—and she
was coming to him!</p>

<p>First, it would mean that Jerry Cardinegh, the man
he had preserved, was dead. If he were dead with
his secret, Noreen would find him—Routledge—identify
herself with the most loathed of outcasts, fleeing forever
before the eyes and fingers of England. There was
rebellion against this in every plane of the man’s
consciousness. He could not suffer his love, nor hers,
to be tested by such a tragedy. He would flee again
from her.... But if old Jerry had remembered
the truth at the last—if the fates had willed him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
tell the monstrous truth—and the Hate of London were
lifted from the name of Routledge, to become a heritage
of Noreen Cardinegh—and then if she should come to
him! He could not cover his eyes to the flash of radiance
which this thought brought him.... He would
have died to prevent such a thing from coming to pass.
For more than a year, he had kept out of the ken of the
world, to forestall any efforts on the part of the Cardineghs,
to find him. He was worn to a shadow, hunted,
harrowed, hated, lost to himself in disguises, ever apart
from the gatherings of men and the decent offerings of
life—all to prevent the very thing which, in thinking of
now, lit every lamp of his being. Quite as readily would
he have performed the treachery for which he suffered
as return to the father of Noreen Cardinegh, saying:
“I am tired, Jerry. Give me back my name.” But if,
after all he had done to spare her from the truth, the
fates ruled against him—<i>then</i> he would not flee from
her!</p>

<p>Hours passed. Every little while, through the piling
cumulus of disorder, would flash the reality, and for
the interval he ceased to breathe.... To think
of looking up from some half-delirium and discovering
her face! To feel the touch of her hand—this woman—attuned
to respond to every vibration of his voice and
brain and heart.... Sometimes he fell into a heresy
of manhood and demanded of himself what significance
had England, the world, compared with the rest of his
days with Noreen Cardinegh, in the glory of their union
which formed a trinity—man and woman and happiness....</p>

<p>He laughed bitterly at the starry distances. “It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
would be a fitting end for a man who is supposed to have
betrayed the country he served—to allow a woman to
share such fortunes as mine, and take up the trail of an
outcast.”</p>

<p>Routledge rose to go to the Rest House, but reflected
that it must be nearer dawn than midnight. He was
curiously disinclined to seek his room at this hour. With
his face to the doorway, he sank down upon the matting
and rested his chin in his palms.... The touch of
Rawder’s hand awoke him, and he stared in wonder at the
<i>chela</i>, his own eyes stinging from the East. The figure
of a woman was prone before him.</p>

<p>“Routledge, my brother, here is work for you. I
found her far out on the road. She was crawling into
Rydamphur, carrying the child. I could not leave her.
She is close to death. Sekar waits for me, and so again,
good-by.”</p>

<p>Rawder had turned with a quick hand-clasp, and
hurried away in the dawn-light to his master. It was all
over quickly and strangely—as some psychic visitation.
Routledge was already weary of the pitiless day. The
blazing temple of dawn had shone full upon his eyelids
as he slept, and there was an ache deep in his brain from
the light.... The woman raised her head from
the ground waveringly, like a crushed serpent, and
plucked at his garments. There was a still, white-lipped
babe at her breast. Her voice was like dried sticks
rubbing together. He held the cup of water to her lips.</p>

<p>“I am the widow of Madan Das, who is dead since
the drouth,” she told him. “The white holy man carried
me here, leaving the other on the road. This is my son—the
son of Madan Das. There were two others, both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
girls, but they are dead since the drouth. Also the
brother of my husband, who was a leper. My husband
worked, but there has been no work since the drouth.
First we sold the cow——”</p>

<p>“My good mother, don’t try to talk,” Routledge said,
as he lifted her into the hut, but she could not understand.
As soon as he had placed her upon the matting,
she took up the tale, thinking that she must tell it all.
Her face was like dusty paper; her lips dried and
stretched apart. Her hair had fallen away in patches, and
her throat was like an aged wrist.</p>

<p>“First we sold the cow,” she mumbled, trying to
find him with her eyes, “then we sold the household
things. After that we sold the doors and door-posts.
Even after that the food was all gone, and my husband,
whose name is Madan Das, gave his clothing to his
brother, who is a leper, to sell in the village for food.
A neighbor lent my husband a cotton cloth to put about
his loins. The <i>chaukadari</i> tax was due. Madan Das
could not pay. We were starving, and one of the babes, a
girl, was dead. The <i>tahsildar</i>” (a collector for the
English) “came and took away from the second babe,
who was in the doorway of our house, a little brass bowl
for the tax. There was in the bowl some soup which my
babe was eating—a little soup made of bark, flower-pods
and wild berries.... Since then there has been
no food. Madan Das is dead, and the two girls are dead,
and the brother of Madan Das, who is a leper, died last
night. The white holy man carried me here, leaving the
other on the road. This is the son of Madan Das——”</p>

<p>Life was going out of her with the words, but she
would not stop. Her heart was pounding like a frightened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
bird’s. The weight of them both was but that of a
healthy child—an armful of dissolution.</p>

<p>“Listen, mother,” Routledge said. “Do not talk any
more. I am going to the Rest House to get food for you
and the son of Madan Das. Lie here and rest. I shall
not be long.”</p>

<p>Even as he left her, she was repeating her story. He
returned with a pitcher of hot tea, strong enough to color
and make palatable the nourishment of half a can of
condensed milk. He brought a servant with him, and a
sheet to cover the woman. Routledge handed the child
to the servant, and lifted the mother’s head to a cup.
Afterward he cleansed her face and throat and arms with
cool water, and bade her sleep.</p>

<p>“The little one is quite well, mother,” he told her
softly. “All is well with you now. The English will
be here to-day with much food, and you have only to
rest. The child eats.”</p>

<p>“He is the son of Madan Das,” she mumbled, “and
I am his mother.... Do not forget.”</p>

<p>She sank into a half-stupor. The servant had spooned
a few drops into the babe’s mouth. Routledge took the
child—a wee thing, light as a kitten, numbed from want,
and too weak to cry. Its body had the feel of a glove,
and the bones showed white under the dry brown skin,
and protruded like the bones of a bat’s wing. The servant
went to fetch a basin of water.</p>

<p>“Why must you, little seedling, learn the hunger-lesson
so soon?” Routledge reflected whimsically. “You
are lots too little to have done any wrong, and if your
bit of a soul is stained with the sins of other lives, you
are lots too little to know that you are being punished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
for them now.... I should have asked Sekar of
what avail is the karmic imposition of hunger upon the
body of a babe.”</p>

<p>He sponged and dried the little one, wrapped him in
a cloth, and fed him again—just a few drops. The son
of Madan Das choked and gurgled furthermore over a
half-spoonful of water.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re not nearly so far gone as your mother,
my son. She was already starving before your inestimable
fountains dried.... And so they took
away your sister’s little brass bowl—and the soup made of
bark and flower-pods and wild berries. The poor <i>tahsildar</i>
must have been very tired and hot that day....
And so your worthy uncle who was a leper sold the
clothing of Madan Das, who borrowed a loin-cloth from
a neighbor, and did not need that very long....
Curl up and sleep on a man’s arm, my wee Rajput.”</p>

<p>Between the two, Routledge passed the forenoon. At
last, miles away across the dusty sun-shot plain eastward,
a bullock-cart appeared, and long afterward behind
it, faint as its shadow, another—and others. Almost
imperceptibly, they moved forward on the twisting, burning
road, like crippled insects; and the poles of the native-drivers
raised from time to time like tortured antennæ.
There was a murmur now within the huts of stricken
Rydamphur. Routledge had sent his baggage west to
the railroad and settled his account at the Rest House.
He would leave with the coming of the famine relief.
The child was better, but the woman could not rally.
The nourishment lay dead within her. The bullock-carts
merely moved in the retina of his eye. He was thinking
deep, unbridled things in the stillness of high noon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>The great law of cause and effect had brought the
answer to his whimsical question of a few hours before.
Why did karma inflict starvation upon the child before
the tablets had formed within him on which the lesson
might be graven for his life’s direction? The son of
Madan Das was but an instrument of punishment for
the mother.... What wrong she must have done,
according to Hindu doctrine, to him in one of the dim
other lives—when she was forced to bring him into the
world, the famine-world of India, forced to love him,
to watch him waste with hunger, and to crawl with him
in the night. Incomparable maternal tragedy. The sins
of how many lives had she not expiated up yonder in
the withered fields!</p>

<p>The woman’s arm flung itself out from her body, and
lay in a checkered patch of sunlight. It made Routledge
think of a dried and shrunken earth-worm which the
morning heat had overtaken upon a wide pavement. Her
eyelids were stretched apart now.</p>

<p>Sierras of tragedy are pictured in the eyes of the
starving. Processes of decay are intricate and marvellous—like
the impulses of growth and replenishing. There is
no dissolution which so masterfully paints itself in the
human eye as Hunger. The ball is lit with the expiration
of the body, filled with a smoky glow of destroying tissue.
The unutterable mysteries of consummation are windowed
there. The body dies, member by member; all
flesh save the binding fibres wastes away, and the hideous
hectic story of it all is told in the widening, ever widening
eyes—even to the glow of the burning-ghats—all is
there.</p>

<p>And the mother’s eyes! She was already old in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
hunger-lesson. The husband, Madan Das; the leper, his
brother; the two little girls; the little brass bowl—all
were gone, when this child ceased to feed upon the
mother’s flesh. And still she crawled with the last of her
body to the town—all for this little son of Madan Das,
who slept the sleep of healing within reach of her arm.</p>

<p>Routledge gazed upon the great passion of motherhood.
In truth, the little hut in Rydamphur had been to
him a place of unfolding revelations. He had seen much
of death in wars, but this war was so poignant, so intimate....
Why did the woman sin? Routledge’s
tired brain forged its own answer on the vast Hindu plan
of triple evolution. Countless changes had carried this
creature, as he himself had been carried, up from a worm
to a human. It is a long journey begun in darkness, and
only through error, and the pains of error, does the soul-fragment
learn to distinguish between the vile and the
beautiful. In the possession of refining senses, and the
travail of their conquering, the soul whitens and expands.
Often the wild horses of the senses burst out of control
of the charioteer of the soul; and for each rushing violence,
the price must be paid in pangs of the body—until
there are no longer lessons of the flesh to be learned, and
the soul puts on its misery no more.... Routledge
came up to blow, like a leviathan, from the deeps of
reflection, and wondered at the feverish energy of his
brain. “I shall be analyzing presently the properties
which go into the crucible for the making of a prophet,”
he declared.</p>

<p>The servant had brought a doctor, but it was mere
formality. Routledge bent over the dying woman. Her
heart filled the hut with its pounding. It ran swift and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
loud, like a ship’s screw, when the clutching Pacific
rollers fall away. In that devouring heat, the chill
settled.</p>

<p>“Do not forget.... He is the son of Madan
Das, and I am his mother——”</p>

<p>“I shall not forget, good mother,” Routledge whispered.
“A worthy man shall take care of him. This,
first of all, shall I attend.”</p>

<p>“Madan Das was a worthy man——”</p>

<p>The rest was as the rattle of ripe seeds in a windblown
pod.... Routledge turned his face from the
final wrench. There was a foot-fall in the sand, and a
shadow upon the threshold, but Routledge raised his hand
for silence. The moment of all life in the flesh when
silence is dearest is the <i>last</i>.... The child stirred
and opened its eyes—roused, who can tell, by its own
needs of a metaphysical sympathy? And what does it
matter? The man covered in the sheet the poor body
which the soul had spurned, and turned to feed the child
again. The American was at the door.</p>

<p>“And have you been specializing in famine at first
hand, Mr. Jasper?” Routledge inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I see, sir, that you have been doing more.”</p>

<p>“The task came to me this morning. A little touch
of motherhood makes the whole world kin, you know....
This baby seal is the son of Madan Das. He is
sleepy, having ridden all night bareback—and the bones
of his mount were sharp.”</p>

<p>“Allow me to say, rather from necessity than any
notion of being pleasant,” Mr. Jasper observed slowly,
“that I think you are a wonderful man.... I
have found myself weak and cowardly and full of strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
sickness. I am going back to the railway filled with a
great dislike for myself. The things which I find to do
here, and want to do, prove a physical impossibility. I
want to leave a hundred pounds in Rydamphur. It is
but a makeshift of a coward. It occurred to me to ask
you how it would be best to leave the money, and where.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be disturbed, Mr. Jasper,” Routledge said,
struck by the realness of the other’s gloom. “I know
the feeling—know it well. A white man is not drilled in
these matters. God, I have been ill, too! I am ill now.
See the soaps and water-basins which I have served with
my ministrations—and I am old in India. It is the weakness
from hunger which makes the people a prey to all the
atrocities of filth and disease. First famine, then plague....
A hundred pounds—that is good of you. I know
a missionary who will thank God directly for it—all night
on his knees—and he will not buy a can of butter for
himself. I will lead you to him if you wish.”</p>

<p>They passed through the village. The English were
coming with the bullock-carts, and the people, all those
who could crawl out of their huts, were gathered in the
blazing sunlight on the public threshing-floor. Mr.
Jasper quickened his step and averted his face....
Routledge had been several days in Rydamphur, and a
guest in most of the huts, but there were many upon the
threshing-floor now (the old in agony, borne there by
the young; loathsome human remnants moving upon
the sand) that he had not seen before. It profited not to
look deeply into that harrowing dream of hell, in the
light of the most high sun, lest the spectacle remain in the
brain, an indissoluble haunt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>“Yes, I know, Mr. Jasper,” Routledge muttered.
“It is shocking as the bottom of the sea—with the waters
drained off. It is the carnal mystery of a famine.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There was but one thing left in Rydamphur for
Routledge to do. It concerned the servant of the Rest
House, whom he had found good, and the little son of
Madan Das.</p>

<p>“This is to be your child,” he said to the man.
“The mother is dead, and the others of the family lie
dead in the country. I am leaving Rydamphur now, but
by chance I shall come back. You shall attend the
mother’s body—and take the child for your own. It is
the wish of the very holy man who tarried here a few
days. It was his <i>chela</i> who carried the woman in from
the country during the night. It is also my wish, and I
leave you money. More money will be forthcoming in
due time. First of all, I want you to buy a little brass
bowl, which shall be the child’s own. Remember the
name. He is the son of Madan Das. And now give me
your name.”</p>

<p>It was done in order. An hour after, when all the
village was attracted to the threshing-floor, and the
bullock-carts were creaking in, and the sweating, harried
Englishmen were pushing back the natives, lest they fall
under the wheels, Mr. Jasper perceived the man who had
so fascinated him set out, alone and without conveyance,
along the sandy western road toward the railroad.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was a night late in October when Routledge
reached Calcutta, where he was forced to sink deeply into
the native life to avoid recognition. With two months’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
files of the <i>Pioneer</i>, he sat down to study the premonitive
mutterings of the Russo-Japanese war. They were wide
in aim, but deep with meaning for the man who had
mastered the old game of war. The point which interested
him most in regard to this inevitable fracture of the
world’s peace was not brought out in the <i>Pioneer</i>. Just
how much did the awful activity of one Tyrone patriot,
Jerry Cardinegh, have to do with the ever bristling negotiations
between Tokyo and St. Petersburg?... In
the light of the present developments, the Anglo-Japanese
alliance was one of the cleverest figments of diplomacy
in the history of national craft. Japan was a fine tool,
with a keen and tempered edge. It would take all the
brute flesh that Russia could mass in Manchuria to blunt
it. Decidedly, Russia would have none left to crumple
the borders of British India. Meanwhile, England had
nothing more serious to do than to collect her regular
Indian tributes, attend her regular Indian famines, and to
vent from time to time a world-wide whoop of encouragement
for her little brown brothers, facing the Bear.</p>

<p>“That reminds me,” Routledge reflected with a start,
“that all this is <i>my</i> work. I took it from Jerry
Cardinegh.”</p>

<p>He breathed hard, and perused again the long, weary
story of negotiations, the preliminary conflict. It appeared
that Russia recognized Japan’s peculiar interest in
Korea, and called it reasonable for her to take charge of
the affairs of the Korean court.... “By the way,”
Routledge mused ironically, “the Anglo-Japanese alliance
was hung on the fact that Korea was to be preserved an
automatic unit. However, the Anglo-Japanese alliance
was hung in haste.”... The Czar observed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
he had a peculiar brotherly regard for Manchuria,
and that Japan must bear in mind that her Korean business
must remain for all time south of the Yalu. “Don’t
cross that river,” said Nicholas.... Ominous
courtesy, rejections, modifications, felicitations, and
the thunder of riveting war-ships in each navy-yard
of the respective Powers involved. Brute boy, Japan, at
a white heat from Hakodate to Nagasaki; Russia sweetly
ignoring the conflagration and sticking for Great Peter’s
dream for a port in the Pacific.</p>

<p>And so it stood when Routledge closed his last <i>Pioneer</i>
in his Calcutta hiding-place, and embarked European
steerage for Shanghai. Two days north of Hong Kong,
the steamer ran into the first breath of winter, and
Routledge drew out the great frieze coat to go ashore in
the Paris of China. Far out on the Hankow road, he
ensconced himself in a small German hostelry, and caught
up with the negotiations through the successive editions
of the <i>North China News</i>. Not a line anywhere regarding
the life or death of Jerry Cardinegh.</p>

<p>Closer and closer, the Powers drew about to hear the
final back-talk between Russia and Japan. The latter
said that she would establish a neutral zone along the
northern Korean frontier, if Russia would do likewise on
the southern frontier of Manchuria. Some humorist in
England observed that you cannot have a neutral zone
without war; and the correspondents set out from England,
via America, where they picked up the men from
New York, Chicago, and Three Oaks—travelling west to
the Far East. At this point, Routledge, with great
secrecy, made possible through a solid friend in New
York, secured credentials, under an assumed name, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
free-lance work in the interests of the <i>World-News</i>.
Thus passed the holidays. The first month of 1904 was
remarkable for the unexampled tension created by Japan
burning the cables for Russia’s last word.</p>

<p>Routledge thrilled in spite of himself. He felt that
this was to be his last service and the biggest. What a
farce were the negotiations, with Japan already a-tramp
with soldiery and the great single-track railroad from
St. Petersburg to Port Arthur groaning with troop-trains;
with India locked tight in the strong white British
hand for at least another decade; with England turned to
watch her Asiatic agent spitted on the Czar’s rusty
bayonets—what a farce, indeed, with Russia willing, and
Japan determined, for war.</p>

<p>Late in January, and a snowy twilight. Routledge
stood for a moment on the Bund in Shanghai. He was
sailing that night for Chifu, and wondering as he stood
in the falling dark, his face concealed in the high-collar,
how fared Jerry Cardinegh in the crux of these great
affairs. Was he dead—or dead in brain only? Of
Noreen—thoughts of Noreen were always with him.</p>

<p>One of the launches of an Empress liner was leaving
the Bund in a few minutes for the ship in the offing—her
nose turned to Japan. Routledge was thinking that
he would have to play the game alone now, if never
before. He smiled at the thought of what the boys gathering
at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo would do if he
should turn up among them.... Suddenly he felt
a man’s eyes fixed upon him from the right. He turned
his head carelessly, and discovered a figure marvelously
like Finacune’s stepping overside into the launch. It
disappeared into the small cabin. Routledge turned his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
back to the launch with that degraded, shrunken sensation
which concealment always incited.</p>

<p>“They would murder me,” he muttered absently.
“I must swing it more than ever alone—from the edges
and alone.”</p>

<p>A woman’s hand touched the sleeve of the great
frieze coat, and Routledge jerked about in a startled way.
Men and wars were obliterated like dry leaves in a flame....
The launch whistled a last time.</p>

CONSPIRACY FORMED AGAINST HIM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry Cardinegh</span> experienced a very swift and
remarkable transition. All the red-blooded hatred with
which he had executed his <i>coup</i> in India was drained
from the man sitting in London. His gigantic scheme
accomplished, Cardinegh withered like a plant overturned
in a furrow. Instead of facing the consequences with
the same iron humor that he had faced the wars of his
time—as he had planned for months, in the event of discovery—his
great mad zeal had burned him out. He
found himself old, run-down, pitiful, hungering for peace,
when his young Messiah had come—praying for the
imperial stimulus of English hatred in order to write a
great book of the craft. In his weakness and in the powerful
attraction of home and Noreen, Cardinegh had not
analyzed the idea seized at random by Routledge. Later
he was incapable. Always the young man had been
strange in his ways and startling in his achievements.
Jerry had sensed the crush of this thing which the other
demanded for a stimulant. Vaguely, the old man pictured
from time to time the “mystic of the wars” sunk and
steeped somewhere in India, turning out stupendous narratives
under the goad of secrecy and peril.</p>

<p>Even the swiftest physical changes are more or less
imperceptible to the victim, whose body is gently numbed,
and mind shadowed by a merciful cloud. The veteran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
felt his years, and talked much of their weight, but he
alone was incapable of perceiving the extent of his ruin.
And what desperate irony was there in the trick which
Nature played upon him! His brain held fast to the
exciting minutiæ of Plevna, and the elder services, but
lost entirely his latest and crowning strategy to encompass
British disaster. He had conceived and carried out
a plan to force a Russo-Indian alliance against England—and
had practically forgotten it. More than that, the fact
that his work had been foiled by England’s counter-alliance
with Japan seemed scarcely to touch his mind
after his last talk with Routledge. Memory served him
mightily from her treasures of old actions, but the record
of his awful lone war and its dreams had been writ in
water.</p>

<p>Cardinegh gradually grew more and more content as
the silence from abroad endured and his own forces
failed. Many Londoners came to pay him homage; and
with a single glance, the visitors understood that it were
wiser to talk of El Obeid and the Chinese Gordon rather
than of the new century. So the old campaigner, busy
with his callers, his pipes and Latakia mixtures, his
whiskies, white and red, finally came to forget for weeks
at a time that the honor of his days was not his own.</p>

<p>Only occasionally, between long periods of serenity,
there would come a stirring tumult to his brain. At such
times he was frightened and speechless. Nameless fears
pulsated through him like the rise and fall of a tempest.
Once when the old man thought he was alone, Noreen
heard him mutter at the fireside: “He’s lost in India
somewhere—working and brooding, the young devil,—but
war will bring him out of his lair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>He was as usual the next morning. Had Noreen not
been altogether in the dark in regard to the specific
charge against Routledge, she could have put this and
other fragments together into a rough form of truth.
The few who knew all, imparted nothing. To the rest,
the name of Routledge was attached to a certain unspeakable
atrocity, and was thus whispered wherever Englishmen
roved and strived. The man’s mysterious figure
had been in the London press for years. England makes
much of her correspondents, and Routledge, the <i>Review</i>
man, had aroused comment from Auckland to Winnipeg—familiar
comment, like the record of a general. A
curse had fallen upon the name now, and it was none the
less heinous because the reason, so far as the multitude
was concerned, was a historical mystery. Articles like
Finacune’s from the field in Bhurpal had given Englishmen
everywhere an idea of the personality of this arch-enemy;
and the fact that Routledge was still alive, and
miraculously unpunished, was a covert challenge to the
British around the world.... Noreen despaired of
learning the truth. The merest mention of the subject
harrowed and discountenanced her father, and netted no
revelation whatsoever.</p>

<p>Hers were stern, hard-checked days, full of heart-hunger.
It seemed to her sometimes as if her individuality
must perish in the midst of this interminable system
of agonies. That last hour in the carriage had left her
thrilling, burning. She wished she had said even more
to show her loyalty.... She thought of Routledge
out on God’s great windy seas—always alone, always on
deck in storms that drove others below; she thought of
him moving in the hidden slums of India, native of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
natives, eternally shadowed from his kind—alone, wasted,
accursed.... Once—it was the same night that he
had slipped from a noose in the house at Madras—she
woke with a scream to find that it was only a dream—that
he was being murdered. Yet she was terrified for
days, as only one can be terrified whose brain is fine
enough to respond to the immaterial currents, molding
and weaving behind all scenes and things.</p>

<p>Often it came to her, “This is my battle. I must
fight it cleanly and without a cry. It is hard for him and
hard for me—as much as we can bear. Only Routledge-san
and I can know how hard—and God, who measures
our strength. But I shall see him again. I shall see him
again. <i>I shall see him again.</i>”</p>

<p>Beyond this, she could never go in coherent thinking.
In calm moments, and without any warning, there would
come to her just a glimpse <i>beyond</i>, but never by deliberately
forcing her thoughts. What glimpses they were,
winged, marvelous,—of a bewildering intensity past the
handling of common faculties.... A great, strong-souled
woman, fashioned with the beauty of angels, and
inspired with a love of the kind that only the dreamers
can know in spirit.... And she held fast to what
was left of her father, loved him, nor allowed the
vision of crossing the world to her lover to militate
against the work of the hour.... As for Routledge
degraded, Routledge-san doing a shameful thing—this
was unthinkable, a masterpiece of evil, one of the world’s
four-dimension errors, which held him outcast in a
wilderness where her soul cried nightly to be.</p>

<p>Autumn of the following year, and still Jerry Cardinegh
sat in the little rooms in Cheer Street, his daughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
ministering.... Noreen made a pilgrimage to
Bookstalls. It was a day reserved from summer, and
she had waited until afternoon when her father napped.
All things were made ready for his comfort when he
awakened, and she had the hours. Her carriage turned
into the rutty, cobble-paved road, narrow and eternally
jammed. The upper front windows of the old house
were closely curtained.... She had never been up
there, though once she had asked to go.... Her
father and others had told her of the wanderer’s trophy-room,
which Routledge kept from year to year and occupied
so seldom. How fared the master in this
hour?...</p>

<p>The street boy who had been with Routledge that
last morning was passing swiftly, carrying the wares of
a pastry-cook upon a tray. He had the look of one who
was trusted and prospering. She called and he ran
forward, but halted in excitement.</p>

<p>“Why, you are the Boy!” she declared joyfully.</p>

<p>His answer was equally engaging: “Has the Man
come back?”</p>

<p>“Won’t you come into the carriage with me—so we
can talk about the Man?” she asked.</p>

<p>Talking about the Man was desirable but forbidden.
Another party had wished to talk about the Man. It
was but a moment after the Man had left him, in the
carriage of this woman. A stranger had touched his
arm, asked queer questions in a clumsy, laughing way,
stood treat variously, and bored for information in the
most startling and unexpected fashion, always laughing.
Altogether that had been a forenoon which made him
damp to remember. Night after night, in the little hall-bedroom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span> 
he had gone over every word which the stranger
had extracted. He felt that the Man would have been
proud of him, but there had been several narrow squeaks....
As for the Man, Johnny Brodie had built his
future and his God-stuff about Him. It wasn’t altogether
a matter of clothes and grub and a room of his
own. There was something deeper and bigger than
that.... And this woman—her chances were slim
about getting anything out of him about the Man.</p>

<p>“I got these ’ere torts to carry?” he said. “Has
the Man come back?”</p>

<p>“No, but we’ll talk about him—when you are through
with your work.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know nothin’ about ’im.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but it’s enough that you know him—and are
fond of him. How long will you be busy?”</p>

<p>“Till dark.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! But you will come to my house after
that, won’t you, Boy? I’ll have a good supper for you—and
some things to take away. You’ll be glad if you
come.... Won’t you come, Boy?”</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Johnny stared at the receding
carriage and at the money in his hand. He had promised
to go to Cheer Street that evening when his work was
done. How it came about, was one of those things which
he must figure out in silence and darkness. Certainly
he had not intended to go. Evidently she was one of
the Man’s possessions, and what a way she had with
her!... Everything about the Man was right. He
was all that a man could and should be. More would
be superfluous and distasteful.... It had looked
as if the Man had wanted to be alone that morning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
when this woman had borne him away in the carriage.
Johnny had never quite forgiven her for that. Possibly
the Man might have had more to say to him if she hadn’t
come.... She wanted to go up into the Room,
but the Man hadn’t allowed that....</p>

<p>“’E took me in, an’ not ’er!” he mused with sudden
amazement.</p>

<p>The long-locked lodging—that Superlative Place!...
Johnny had a pet dream. He was back on the
stairs, and the Man came and carried him up into that
place of kingliest attraction. Those were rooms like a
man ought to have—shields, guns, knives, saddles, tufts
of hair (certainly scalps), chain-shirts, and shirts with
tattoo-marks all over; and there was one saddle, with
mud still on the stirrups, sorrel hair on the cinch, and
a horsy smell.... Johnny jerked himself out of his
delectable memories.</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” he muttered; “but she needn’t think she’ll
’ear anything about ’im from me.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Noreen returned to Cheer Street in the twilight,
troubled by the thought that there was to be company in
the evening. She had forgotten, and wanted the whole
time with the boy.... He had passed the night in
the lodgings with Routledge—the very hours which had
made an outcast of her lover. What might the boy not
have heard? At least he knew the Man—one soul in
London who knew Routledge and did not seek to crush
him.</p>

<p>Her father regarded her hungrily as she entered.</p>

<p>“You’ve been gone long, Noreen,” he said. “’Tis a
queer thing that comes over a man with the years, deere.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
I was thinking this afternoon of going away for a year—the
thought of it! It’s all gone from me. Old Jerry is
off to the wars no more, unless they furnish portable
pavilions for the women of the correspondents.”</p>

<p>She knew that his liveliness was unnatural, but so
much of her work was mere service for the tragic effacement
of a loved one, that she brightened responsively to
his slightest mental activity. Dinner was nearly over
when the door-bell rang. Noreen left her father at the
table and admitted Johnny Brodie, leading him into the
sitting-room.</p>

<p>He removed his cap carefully, uncovering a noble
achievement of water, wrought against gritty odds, with
a certain treasured pair of military brushes. The cap
was carelessly stuck in his pocket. His shoes—but the
blacking of Bookstalls and many other roads had the
start of months and asserted itself before the drying fire
above the recent veneer of the stranger brand. Johnny
Brodie looked captured and uncomfortable, so that
Noreen despaired to win him. Had he been older or
younger, she could not have failed; but there he sat, a
male creature all deformed by years and emotions, precocities
and vacuities—a stained and handicapped little
nobleman, all boy, and all to the good.</p>

<p>“We haven’t heard from the Man, either, Johnny,”
she said. “We are terribly worried about him and
awfully interested. I know he was very fond of you,
and I hoped you could tell us something about him. Did
you know him long?”</p>

<p>“Nope.” The boy wondered who else was included
in the “we.”</p>

<p>“But that morning you seemed to have such a fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
and complete understanding. Did you often spend a
night with him?”</p>

<p>“Nope. We was fren’s, though. ’E’s the right sort.
Gives me a bloomin’ Tommy’s harmy blanket to sleep in,
and wen I goes to get into me boots—they’re filled wit
bobs an’ tanners. I looks up, an’ ’e’s grinnin’—as if ’e
didn’t know as to ’ow they got there.”</p>

<p>It was all replenishment to her veins. “And didn’t
he go to sleep that night, Johnny?” she asked softly.</p>

<p>“’Ow should I know?” he demanded innocently.</p>

<p>“I thought maybe you’d know. He told me—that
is, I know he had a visitor besides you that night.”</p>

<p>Manifestly this would never do. Noreen felt uncomfortable
in her probing. She must make him see how
important anything he might say would be not only to
her, but to the Man.... As for what the boy knew,
an analyst, or, better, an alienist, would be necessary to
piece into a garment of reason his poor little patches of
understanding, in regard to what he had heard that
night—names of men and places and deeds outside
of Bookstalls. The fact that Johnny Brodie did not
understand, was no reason why he should uncover his
patches to this woman who understood so much. He
was a little afraid of her, and not a little sorry that he
had come. He felt, in spite of himself, that his face
was telling her that he knew a great deal about that night.
He squirmed.</p>

<p>Noreen sensed many of his mental operations, arose
and knelt before him, her elbows upon his knees, and
looked up into his face.</p>

<p>“Boy,” she whispered, “you are very good and dear
to me for trying to keep his secrets. He is a great and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
good man, who means very much to you and to me. He
is doing for some one else (who cannot love him as you
and I do) a great thing and a hard thing, which keeps
him away from us. So long as the secret is kept, Boy,
he will have to stay away, but if we knew the secret we
could bring him back to us and be very happy....
I want you to tell me all that you know, all that you
heard that night while the visitor was there—but before
you do you must understand that you are doing only
good for him. His good, his welfare, is life and death
to me. I love this man, Johnny Brodie, I think even
better than you do. Won’t you help me to bring him
back?”</p>

<p>His eyes were wide with temptation. He longed
to consult her about the laughing stranger who had
pumped him. Many things had happened to him in
twelve flying, graceless years, but nothing like this.
Never would come another moment like this—with the
woman, whom Bookstalls had gasped at the sight of,
kneeling before him. The fate of a city might well
have wavered in the balance before the pleading of
such a woman. He had a premonitive sense that
this moment would become more significant the older
he grew. She overturned half his resistance with the
single fact of sharing with him the possession of the
Man and acknowledging his almost co-equal rights in
all that pertained. It was not her interest, but <i>their</i>
interest.... And then—the seething curiosity for
months—this woman could tell him why the Man wanted
the Hate of London! There could be no mistake about
this last. The Man had begged for it in many ways and
in such language as was never heard in Bookstalls,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
except in the Socialist’s Hall. How could one old man,
all scarred and shot up, give him the Hate of London?</p>

<p>At this instant Jerry Cardinegh opened the door from
the dining-room. Noreen felt the little body turn rigid
under her hands and saw the thin jaw tighten. As she
turned hastily to her father, she heard Johnny Brodie’s
voice—the voice of one who has triumphed over
temptation:</p>

<p>“Ask ’im! Wot yer askin’ me fer—wen ’e knows?”</p>

<p>She hurried to lead her father back into the dining-room,
but he could not stir. His eyes had fixed themselves
upon the boy, and seemed to be draining from
him some deadly poison. His liquor betrayed him, as
it ever betrays the old and the fallen. The tissue it had
sustained collapsed in his veins and the low light left
his brain. Only there remained horror as of a basilisk
upon his face. His bright, staring eyes had a look of
isolation in the midst of altered ashen features.</p>

<p>It was too much for Johnny Brodie—this quick formation
of havoc on the face that had been florid and
smiling. Moreover, he saw the conspiracy against him
in the woman and the old man. He clapped his hand
to his pocket—the cap was where it belonged—bolted
into the hall and down the stairs.</p>

<p>Noreen’s lips formed to call his name, but the look
of her father forbade. She heard the slam of the front
door.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THIRTEENTH CHAPTER<br>

<small>JERRY CARDINEGH OFFERS A TOAST TO THE OUTCAST—A
TOAST HE IS COMPELLED
TO DRINK ALONE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was but one face in the world—the face of
the boy who had so startled Jerry Cardinegh in Routledge’s
rooms their last night together—that could have
brought to the old man as now the falsity of his position,
the shame of his silence, and the horrid closing of
his life. Routledge himself could not have done this,
for he would have returned with a smile and a grip of
the hand. Cardinegh had received in full voltage the
galvanism Routledge had craved as a boon. He tried
to speak, but the sound in his throat was like dice
shaking in a leather box. He tried again unavailingly,
and sank into a chair. Noreen brought the whiskey.</p>

<p>“Why, father, it was just a little boy whom Routledge-san
knew,” she soothed. “I found him on the
street to-day, and asked him to come to see us to-night—because
he had known Routledge-san.”</p>

<p>For an hour he sat quietly, and neither spoke.</p>

<p>The bell rang. Noreen steeled herself to meet a
party of correspondents who had promised to drop in
upon Jerry that night. The old king was not forgotten
by the princes of the craft, and his daughter was
unforgettable.</p>

<p>“Are you well enough to see the boys, father?”</p>

<p>In the past hour the old man had felt the fear of
his daughter’s presence, a deadly fear of questions. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
sort of hopeless idea came to him—that men in the room
would be a defense—until he was himself again.</p>

<p>“Of course. Bring them in.... The little
chap—— ... I was gripped of a sudden....
It’s an old dog at best, I am, deere!”</p>

<p>Finacune, as handsome as a young rose-vine in his
evening wear; the heavy, panting Trollope, who put on
weight prodigiously between wars; Feeney, with his
look of gloom, as if a doom-song were forever chanting
in his brain; and young Benton Day, of slight but very
promising service, the man who was to take Routledge’s
place on the <i>Review</i> in the event of war—these filled the
Cheer Street sitting-room with brisk affairs. Noreen’s
heart was in the dark with the little boy fleeing back to
Bookstalls through the noisy October night. Old Jerry
was shaken up and embraced. There was to be a full
gathering of war-scribes at Tetley’s later, to discuss the
Russian reply to certain Japanese proposals received by
cable in the afternoon. The dean was invited to preside.
Noreen saw the pained look in the eyes of Finacune as
he relaxed her father’s hand.</p>

<p>“I’ll not go,” said Jerry. “I drink enough at home,
sure. Did you say Russia has been talking back—though
it’s little interest I have in rumors of war? It’s a boy’s
work.”</p>

<p>“The Czar says Japan may run Korea, but as for
Manchuria it is, ‘Hands off, Brownie.’” said Finacune.</p>

<p>“Which means——” Trollope began.</p>

<p>“The same old tie-up,” added Finacune. “Only
closer to the cutting. Cable to the <i>Pan-Anglo</i> this
afternoon declares that Japan has already granted the
inevitability of war.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>“Russia suggests,” Benton Day observed carefully,
“that Japan offer no military demonstration in Korea
from the Yalu down to 40°. Japan says in reply that
she must have a similar zone of gunless activity, then,
north of the Yalu.”</p>

<p>“And the fact is,” said Feeney, “they’ll be shooting
at each other from bank to bank before the ice is out
in the spring.”</p>

<p>“It’s a theory of mine,” Trollope offered, “that
Japan will sink a Russian battleship or blow up a Russian
troop-train, and then observe playfully that further negotiations
are uncalled-for.”</p>

<p>Jerry was staring at the carpet, apparently in deep
thought. Noreen was close to Finacune.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask him again to go to Tetley’s with you
to-night,” she whispered. “He is far from well.”</p>

<p>“I thought it would cheer him up—to preside over
an old-fashioned session of prayer for action.”</p>

<p>She shook her head. Her father now stared about
from face to face and finally fixed upon her the nervous
smile.</p>

<p>“There’s a deere,” he said, “run and see if the
dinner things are cleared away. We must get about the
board—for a toast to the work ahead.... Come,
boys, to the dining-room.”</p>

<p>They obeyed with enthusiasm. Glasses and things
were brought by Noreen. Jerry sat rigid at the head,
perspiration upon his brow, the struggle for light to
think by in his brain. The men felt the strain, and
pitied the woman.</p>

<p>“And what does England do in all this?” Cardinegh
asked huskily, after a painful pause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>Old Feeney was nearest the dean. He dropped his
hand upon the other’s arm in a quiet way. “England
boosts for Japan, Jerry,” he replied. All were eager to
relieve the strain by a detailed discussion on any subject,
but the dean renewed:</p>

<p>“And is all quiet in India?”</p>

<p>“Quiet as the ‘orchard lands of long ago,’” said
Finacune.</p>

<p>There was something in the old man’s voice which
suggested to Noreen the long forgotten passion—so out
of place here. She trembled lest he should prove unable
to handle himself.</p>

<p>“<i>England</i>——” Cardinegh rumbled the name. It was
as if he were fighting for a grasp upon all that the
gigantic word had meant to him. “England ought to
be down there fighting the Czar on the British-Indian
border—not on the Yalu.”</p>

<p>It was clear to all why England was not embroiled
with Russia—the Anglo-Japanese alliance—save to the
old man who should have known best. The truth
thundered now in the clouds of his brain, but he could not
interpret. Nobody spoke, for the dean’s hand was raised
to hold the attention. The gesture was a pitiful attempt
to assist him to concentrate. He faltered helplessly, and
finally uttered the words nearest his lips:</p>

<p>“Finacune, the florid,—you’re for the <i>Word</i> as
usual?”</p>

<p>They all breathed again. The old man had found
a lead.</p>

<p>“Always for the <i>Word</i>, Jerry—I write war for the
skirt-departments of London.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“And you, Blue Boar—for the <i>Examiner</i>?” he
demanded of Trollope.</p>

<p>“The same.”</p>

<p>“And Benton Day—you——” Cardinegh’s expression
suddenly became single-pointed. Here were breakers
again.</p>

<p>“It’s not rightly settled, sir. I’ve got lines out
severally. I really do want to go.”</p>

<p>“Then Dartmore didn’t call you to the <i>Review</i> yet?”</p>

<p>“I did speak with Dartmore,” said Day. “Things
are not altogether settled, though.”</p>

<p>Jerry regarded him for a second, as if to say, “I’ll
get back to you, young man, when I am through with
this peroration.”</p>

<p>“And, Bingley, the ‘Horse-killer’?” he resumed.</p>

<p>“Goes out for the <i>Thames</i>, as usual. There’s a lad
that means to make us all sweat,” Finacune said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Feeney—you old were-wolf—you’ve been scratching
old Mother Earth in the raw places—almost as long
as I have. What are you out for this time?”</p>

<p>Feeney hesitated, and Trollope dragged out the
answer: “All kinds of berths for Feeney. The <i>Thames</i>
will put out a dispatch-boat which he can command if
he likes. The <i>Pan-Anglo</i> wants him for the Russian
end. Also he’s got an offer to follow the Japanese.
Feeney told me more about the Yalu country, and that
new cartridge-belt of creation, while we were walking
over here to-night—red-beard bandits, Russian grand
dukes, Japanese spies, <i>with queues</i>, who have been
mapping Manchuria for ten years—than any white man
has a right to know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>The fact was that old Feeney had about closed to
go out for the <i>Witness</i>, which Jerry had left open.</p>

<p>“There’s no need of asking about Talliaferro,”
Cardinegh said impatiently.</p>

<p>“No, Talliaferro is Peter Pellen’s ‘Excalibur,’ as
usual; and will set out on schedule for the Yalu or the
Gugger—wherever the fronts meet.”</p>

<p>“And the <i>Witness</i>?” Jerry said, clearing his throat.
His thoughts were like birds starting up in the dusk,
clots of night without name and form.</p>

<p>Finacune arose and filled the breech. “The <i>Witness</i>
awaits the word of the greatest of us all—our dean,
Jerry Cardinegh. I propose now a drink to him standing—to
the greatest of our kind!”</p>

<p>Personal vanity had never fallen into the senility of
the Irishman, but he arose with the others, and his
face caught up an old wild look familiar to everyone
in the room, as he raised his hand to speak:</p>

<p>“Let us drink to the greatest of us all, as you say,—not
to the decayed correspondent which the <i>Witness</i> does
<i>not</i> wait for.” His eyes flashed with a sudden memory
of the windy night in Bhurpal. “Let us drink to the
greatest of us all—‘the man whom the gods formed for
a war-correspondent—or a spy, as you like—whom they
tempered in hell’s fire and holy water’—drink to Cosmo
Routledge, already afield!”</p>

<p>The old man did not note the suppressed disorder,
nor the dawn of joy on the face of his daughter.</p>

<p>“I remember he called me the ‘damaged archangel’
that night,” he added softly, and turned to Benton Day:
“God be with him this night—and with you, too, lad—for
you’ll need Him—to take his place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>Jerry drank ceremoniously and alone, but there was
a fuller tribute than any emptied glass ever tokened—in
the brimming eyes of Noreen.... The boys
were in the hall.</p>

<p>“I’m going—not to war, lads—but to bed,” Cardinegh
said, and presently called after them at the door:
“May the patchwork for peace fail to cover the knees
of the nations!”</p>

<p>Noreen was alone. Her brain, sensitive from weariness
and wounds, moved swiftly, restlessly. She knew
at this moment the correspondents would be discussing
the phases of her father’s madness—whispering at
Tetley’s of the fall of the chieftain. Later, at the banquet-table,
when the wines swept away all lesser regards,
they would no longer whisper.... These men
were her friends all. Not one would have hesitated to
serve her well in any need. She did not want to do
them an injustice; and yet there was something in their
minds that was stinging and foreign now. The cause was
in her own mind, and she realized it. They were big
among men, big among their kind, honorable and genuine,
but it was not in human reason for them to share
her immutable trust, any more than they could share
the feminine outpouring of her heart for the man afield.
Also she knew that there were few things in this world
that Routledge could have done wicked enough to shake
these men so utterly from allegiance to him. He had
been to them a mystical attraction of virtue, as he was
now in their eyes the imperator among criminals.</p>

<p>She understood something of what her father had
passed through in the recent hours. The sight of the
Bookstalls boy had withered him like some disordered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
ghost; and yet, to her, there was a greater tragedy in
watching her father try to hold his old place as chief at
the table of war-men. He had not lost that king-torture
of consciousness which showed him that he was not as he
had been. His struggle to cast out the abiding fatuities,
and to regain his old high place of mental activity, was
terrible to witness—like the suspension of his faculties
upon a cross.</p>

<p>Little could be added now to Noreen’s suffering. It
is not given to one in the depths to realize what perfect
soul-substance the recent months had brought her. The
thought had come in her happier reactions, that if she
were like other human beings, the patience, the self-control,
and the purity of her yearning—this bearing all
cleanly and without a cry—was great with tempering
and expansion. But the hunger within her was deep and
masterful for the end of it all. As never before, she felt
the need of a human force to lean upon. There was
neither priest nor pastor nor woman in her life. Her
heart cried out for a greatness such as Routledge had
suggested in Rawder. To her, their bravest man was a
splendid, glowing picture of sorrows; before such a one
she could have knelt and found healing, indeed....
And with what infinite content could she have knelt in this
hour before the disciple of Rawder!</p>

<p>It is a dear but delicate thing to chronicle that matters
of sex were practically untouched by the mind of the
woman in so far as Routledge was concerned. Not at
all did she despise these matters; nor is it to be inferred
that she was one of those miraculous innocents who
reach maturity with a mind virgin to the mysteries of
creation. She had felt with a thrilling, exquisite sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
the imperious young summer of her life, and all that
throbbing veins and swift-running dreams mean under
the steady stars.... But the call to her out of
all creation—which was the voice of Routledge—was
vital with a rounder and more wonderful vibrance.</p>

<p>One art of his that had found the heart of her was
his conception of the inner loveliness of life. He caught
the finer relation of things. He could love the lowliest,
hunger with them, and realize in their midst the brotherhood
of man. He perceived the great truths everywhere
which purely physical men, of necessity, must miss. His
discovery of Rawder was great with meaning to Noreen,
and his adoration for those silent sacrifices which summed
into a life of glory unobserved by the world. He could
love India without hating England. He could be the
greatest of war-scribes and despise war. He laughed
at material possessions and bowed before breech-clout
chivalry. He had witnessed processes of life and death
in their most cruel, intricate, and abominable manifestations,
but had preserved his optimism. This, which so
many words are required even to suggest—and which is
covered in the single expression, <i>soul growth</i>—was the
rousing, irresistible appeal of Routledge to the woman
whose spiritual age was sufficient to respond to it.</p>

<p>The man’s intellect—in contrast to the enchanting
mystic element of his mind—compelled, stimulated, and
enfolded her own. When Routledge talked, such a
sympathy was aroused within her that she could watch
the play of scenes before his eyes, the tithe of which only
he told. In all that he had said and written she found the
same smooth-running, high-powered intelligence. She
had never touched his limitations, therefore infinity could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
hold no greater delights. She loved the harmony of his
talents and the sterling, one-pointed direction of a man
whose life is apart from the complicated lives of modern
men. All dimensions of knowledge were in his mind;
and yet its surfaces were free from taints and scar-tissue,
preserved with virginities. His thoughts had that firm
delicacy of the strong, and some of his thoughts had
ripened in mystic suns and rains.</p>

<p>Once she had been but one of many champions of
the man and his work. From time to time under his
name, the <i>Review</i> had ignited London. The men of his
world and hers had granted his supremacy as a picture-maker
of war—and yet to her this was one of his lesser
attractions. She loved to look into his conception of
things <i>back of the words</i>. How pitiably often were the
words shaped to meet the so-called needs of a daily
paper, as the bones of a Chinese foot are crushed into
a thimble. It was the master behind the narrator; the
man who lived and moved in a wonderland that was a
hopeless arcanum to the many; the man who glimpsed
the temple of truth, if not from within, at least from the
gardens—it was he who fascinated the woman. And
since she loved him, she was proud that his intelligence
enfolded her own.</p>

<p>The physical man, Routledge, all men had found
excellent in those good days before the mystery. His
endurance and bravery had formed many classics for
his craft. He had always bewitched her father. Incidentally,
her life among the many friends of her father—soldiers,
seamen, and civilian campaigners—had taught
her that man’s judgment for man is best.... But
it was not Routledge, the fearless and tireless; not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
Routledge, the male, who called her so ardently this
night. At least, it was less the male than the mind; and
less the mind than the mystic.... It would be
the idlest affectation to assert that actual marriage with
Routledge was beyond the pale of her thoughts; and
yet this was not her ultimate passion. To be with him
in great wanderings of gentle purport; to meet the suns
and storms with calmness and cheer; constantly to toil
together, helping, meditating, always together on the
world’s highways, always looking toward God’s Good
Hope, with thoughts in the stars, but not so lost in the
stars that they missed the sorrowing by the roadside;—wandering
grateful for life together, having a tear for
the helpless, a smile for the beautiful, and a love for
each other so vast and pure that it must needs love the
world and reflect the love of God.... Such was
Noreen Cardinegh’s dream of the fullness of days—so
great a gratitude to the Most High for the presence of
her lover, that it would manifest itself in eternal services
to those who could not be so happy—services that faltered
before no pain, quailed before no horrent spectacle,
and retained their sweet savor in the lowliest haunts
of men.</p>

<p>Marriage.... It might come. In some
garden of the world, there might be a halting, when the
full tides of life swelled together. No fixed date, exterior
formality; no words uttered by a Third could release
these two for triumphant nuptial flight!... She
had seen too much mangling of this intimate and portentous
moment between man and woman, by a stranger,
the member of a paid profession—how often the mere
licensed liberator of lusts. A signal from him, as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
runners set for a Marathon—the <i>spirit</i> of chastity already
a ghost....</p>

<p>If she should some time turn in the day’s journey and
meet in the eyes of Cosmo Routledge that challenge
which startled her into full-length a woman—with old
Nature’s anthem flooding her vein and brain—then of
all times, in their incarnation, would there be but the
hand of the conqueror to lead her to the place the earth-gods
had made ready!... After that, the formalities,
the blessings—and the law which, being good for
the many, is necessary for all....</p>

<p>She leaned against the mantel and closed her eyes,
trying to find her lover’s lodge this night in the wilderness
of the world.</p>

<p>“Nor—Noreen!”</p>

<p>The voice, rough, charged with fright in itself, shook
the woman to the very roots of her life. Her whole
psychic force had winged away to find the mate; only
her body was in the silent room in Cheer Street. There
is a thrilling hurt in the sudden intrusion of physical
force upon such contemplation. She ran to her father’s
room.</p>

<p>“Eh, Gawd! I—I was dreaming, child,” he mumbled,
as she entered the dark where he lay.</p>

<small>ROUTLEDGE IS ASSURED OF A WOMAN’S LOVE—THOUGH
HE SHOULD LEAD THE ARMIES
OF THE WORLD TO BURN LONDON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hai</span>, Johnny Brodie of Bookstalls, there’s a sweet
lady looking for you! Possibly you know it, scamp,
and are tricking from doorway to doorway behind her
carriage, and grinning because those of whom she inquires
don’t know a little maverick like you....
You think she is out to do harm to the Man; and you
won’t be caught with her elbows on your knees again,
and her great gold-brown eyes boring into your hard
head where the Man’s sacred secrets are!... Perhaps
you will, after all, Johnny Brodie, but it will be
after this narrative (when there are lights again in that
room of mystery and enchantment across the hall), and
the Man is back in Bookstalls, there being no further
need of secrets.... The Hate of London will never
change direction by reason of gossip of yours, Johnny
Brodie, because “the best fellows in this world are those
strong enough to hold their tongues at the right time.”
You learned that lesson, Manikin. Did you learn the
other so well—about it not being good to do a thing
alone, which you wouldn’t do if the one you liked best
in the world were watching? That’s a harder lesson....
No, it won’t be your revelation of that impregnable
night which brings the outcast into love and laurels,
but so badly have you frightened a poor old man that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
is about to rush half around the world to avoid meeting
you again—instead of dying in Cheer Street....
Your short-trousered part in these events ended with the
slam of the Cheer Street door, Johnny Brodie—but God
love you, little boy, and Johnny Brodies everywhere!...</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The next morning, and thrice in the week following,
Noreen Cardinegh drove to Bookstalls and threaded the
unkempt way up and down in vain for the boy. She
had failed to learn the name of the pastry-cook who
employed him, and it would have been her last thought
to seek him in the house of Routledge’s lodgings.
Though a familiar in Bookstalls, he was an unfiled human
document of the ancient highway; and always she returned
to Cheer Street profitless.... It would be
merciless to question her father; and yet he seemed to
divine her anxiety to find the boy, and to fear her success
as a visitation of death. It was hard for her to see him,
the man whose courage had been a point of British comment
for forty years, white, shaken, and exhausted from
suspense when she returned from Bookstalls. Still, he
dared not ask if she had seen the boy; and she did not
confess that she had been searching.</p>

<p>Her only line on the mystery was to this effect:
Routledge, though innocent, was blamed by England for
some appalling, unmentionable crime, openly unpunishable.
Her father and a few others knew the specific
charge. Routledge had not known this at the Armory,
but knew it the morning afterward. Meanwhile, her
father and Johnny Brodie had been with him. All the
boy’s actions denoted that he knew something, possibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
a great deal in a fragmentary way, which she might be
able to piece together into an illumination. He must
have known something, since he apparently had been
pledged to silence. At all events, he was lost.</p>

<p>It must be understood that Noreen’s conviction of
her father’s integrity had never been shaken. It was
more than a family faith. His life had been as a record
accessible to all men. It did not even occur to her to
build a system of reasoning upon the hypothesis of any
guilt of his, even though much was strange and foreboding.
She had heard her father mutter that a war would
bring Routledge out of his lair. She could not forget
that her father had come back from India on the day
of the Reception, all consumed and brain-numbed from
strain. For a moment in her arms he had broken completely—acting
like one who was to be dragged from
her to the gallows. The next morning, after his return
to Cheer Street from Routledge, the tension was gone.</p>

<p>Comparative peace had endured, with only an occasional
restless interval, until the sight of the Bookstalls
boy had filled him with inexplicable dread. His condition
when she returned from her fourth journey to Bookstalls
was such that she determined not to go again. One of
two results was inevitable if this devouring tension was
not speedily relaxed—utter insanity or swift death. One
more circumstance in this connection intensified the mystery,
even though it gave her gladness—her father’s toast
to the outcast, the toast that was drunk alone. He was
without that poisonous personal hatred which the others
manifested toward Routledge. All these thoughts had
worn grooves in her mind from much passing, but they
did not evolve her father’s shame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>Throughout the week, the correspondents had dropped
in by twos and threes to bid them good-by. Negotiations
were at a dead-lock, and the London dailies wanted their
men on the spot for eventualities. Most of the men were
going west to the Far East—the twenty-five day route,
via America. Some one, however, mentioned Suez, and
the name was on Jerry Cardinegh’s lips for an entire
afternoon. At dinner his idea broke into words:</p>

<p>“Come, deere, we must pack to-night. We’re off
to-morrow for Japan on the P. &amp; O. liner, <i>Carthusian</i>.
We can smell the ruction in Japan—and it’s a good place
to live. London—aye, God, the old town is murdering
me!”</p>

<p>She had thought of it many times, but until last week
her father had been happy in Cheer Street, entirely
immune to the war ferment. Noreen understood what
had turned London into an iron pressure—one little boy,
lost in din and fog and multitudes. She was glad to go
away.</p>

<p>The first few days at sea helped her father, but the
improvement did not last. They travelled very leisurely,
sometimes stopping over a ship in different ports. It
was with a quickened heart that the woman saw the
Indian coast again after several years. Routledge was
intricately identified with the India of her mind now,
and she knew that somewhere in India he was living out
his exile. Always in those days and nights of watching
and labor with the sleepless old man who was leaving
her hourly, with the accelerated speed of a river that
nears its falls, she was thrilled with the hope that Bombay
or Madras or Calcutta would give her some living word
of the outcast. She hardly hoped to see Routledge; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
with a triple hunger she yearned to hear that he lived,
even to hear his name uttered by some one in whom the
mystery had inspired hatred.... But the Indian
ports furnished nothing concerning Routledge. They
revived, however (and in her maturity), the half-formed
impressions of her girlhood on the Anglo-Indians and
their life. To observe and despise certain aspects of the
ruling people was as certain a heritage from her father
as was that fairer evolution of the spirit with which she
had been blest by some elder lineage.</p>

<p>The English at Home, Noreen had ever regarded
with a mental reservation, or two; and with those telling,
divining eyes which are not rarely filled with Irish light.
She had repressed and even tried to root out an instinctive
animus for certain monuments and institutions large
in British life; she tried constantly to shut her eyes to
that quarry of self-infatuation, perdition deep, from
which these monuments and institutions were carved.
She came to triumph over her critical impulses at home,
partly because her incisive barbs were dulled by constant
contact and repetition—but India again after the few
vital years of growth!... Londoners might forget
themselves for an hour or two a day on the Thames.
They allowed it to be taken for granted an hour or two a
day at Home that they were English. In India, they were
more English than the English.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that Noreen Cardinegh’s
mind was the arena of interminable rebellion against the
banishment of Routledge. All Englishmen of rank
arrayed themselves in contrast to him. She knew that
this was wrong, useless; that the energy which spent
itself in contrasting to the disfavor of the English,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
reacted with a hurt to her own finest nature, but she
could not help it now. As a daughter of Jerry Cardinegh,
she could not be free from something of his passion;
moreover, body and brain, she was spent in his service.
There were vast areas of unhealed tissue within her—the
agony of a daughter of strong devotion, and the
agony of a woman whose romance is mined and countermined.
So it was a weary and supersensitive nature
that caught its new series of impressions of Anglo-Indian
life—the life of pegs and chits; men moving in a
circle like those lost in the woods; men speaking of their
livers as of members of the family; hot, heavy dinners;
the religious, life-and-death ceremony of eating and
drinking; the arrogant assumption of superiority over
the native, and each separate foreigner a cyst of the
great British drain! Such were the men of the Indian
ports to whom the name of Cosmo Routledge was as
black magic. It all came back to her like an ugly dream,
and it is not strange that she returned speedily to her
ships to cleanse herself from her thoughts in the prophylactic
sea-winds.</p>

<p>A day north out of Hong Kong on one of the
Empress steamers, Noreen drew her chair to a sheltered
place on the promenade to rest an hour. The afternoon
was keen and renovating after the slow days of heat in
the Indian Ocean. Two Americans were standing at a
little distance, and one was speaking with animation.
A sentence of his reached the woman’s ears from time
to time, between boisterous rushes of wind....
“One of the best talkers I ever heard in my life.”...
“No personal hate about it.”... “Literally
quartered England and fed her to the pigs.”...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
“No, wouldn’t give me his name, but I learned
it.”... “When I mentioned his name afterward
to an Englishman, he turned pale, as if I had turned loose
the devil.”... “Speaking of famine conditions,
this Routledge——”</p>

<p>Mr. Jasper, whose Indian studies had been put aside
for the time by the pressing call of human interest to
Tokyo, turned quickly just now at the touch of a hand
upon his sleeve, and found a woman whose face he is
still remembering—even as he enjoys recalling all the
words and phrases of the mysterious stranger of
Rydamphur.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, sir,” Noreen panted, “but I could not
help overhearing something you said. You—you mentioned
a name that is very dear to me—Routledge!”</p>

<p>“I did—yes. A man I met in Rydamphur, of the
Central Provinces of India. Excuse me, did you say he
was dear to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That is so queer—a rather pleasant surprise for me.
Others have felt differently about Routledge. Are you
sure you mean this man—a very tall fellow of thirty-three
or thirty-four, with a thin, dark, striking face,
and a striking way of putting things in words?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said breathlessly.</p>

<p>Jasper offered his card.</p>

<p>“I am Miss Cardinegh, Mr. Jasper. Won’t you
please tell me all that you can about him. It means so
much to me.... Shall we go into the reading-room?”</p>

<p>Jasper assented, begging leave from his companion....
They sat down together, and the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
restored Rydamphur from memory. Since he had thought
much of his day and night in that little centre of suffering,
he built the picture rather well. He described the
manner of Routledge, and related a few of the famine
facts as he had drawn them in that evening-hour at the
Rest House.</p>

<p>“As I look back on it all, there is a queer atmosphere
about the whole affair,” said Jasper. “Such a place I
never have known, as that little dining-room in Rydamphur.
Mr. Routledge seemed to grasp at once that my
interest was sincere. His mind was filled with the pith
of things I wanted to learn. No Englishman seemed to
be able to talk impersonally on the famine.... I’ll
never forget the baking night in that house. The
punkahs jerked every moment or so, as if the coolie had
stopped to scratch himself. There was a cat-footed
servant hanging about, and the lamps were turned low—as
if a bright flame could not live in that burned air.”</p>

<p>Mr. Jasper took evident pleasure in the intensity of
interest his narrative inspired. “But first I must tell
you, Miss Cardinegh,” he went on, “that just as I
entered the town in the afternoon, I passed a little hut
with an open door. The breath that came out to me,
I’ll not attempt to describe: only to say that there was
in it more than realism. I had come far to see a real
famine, and this was my first lesson. A few steps on
from the hut, I turned to see a white man coming out.
It was not Mr. Routledge, but a smaller man, dressed in
native garb. I have thought much of his face. It had
a look as if all the tragedies that a man can know had
beaten upon it; and yet it was so strong and so calm....
It was all like a dream to me. Then this wonderful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
talk with Mr. Routledge at dinner. Afterward,
I asked his name, but he withheld it laughingly—in such
a way that I took no offense—only wondered at it.”</p>

<p>“But you learned his name——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will tell you. That night after he left me,
I went to my room and thought a long time on the
things he had said. I remember one of his sayings
impressed me greatly—that we of the occident had
learned to suffer only through our excesses—but India
through her famines. He intimated that the latter
process is better for the soul.... It was too hot
to think of sleep, so I went out to walk in that still,
stricken place. At the far end of the street, I saw a
candle-light and heard the voice of a white man. And
that voice I shall never forget—so low was it, so thrilling
and gentle. I remember the words—they were printed
on some inner wall of my brain. This is what the voice
said:</p>

<p>“‘... Night and morning, I shall send you my
blessing, Routledge, my brother. Morning and evening,
until we meet again in the Leper Valley, you shall know
that there is a heart that longs for the good of your
life and your soul. Good-by.’... I hurried back,
lest it be thought that I was eavesdropping. The man
who spoke was the white man in native garb who had
emerged in the afternoon from that hut of unburied
dead. The man whom he addressed as ‘Routledge’—and
thus I learned his name—was the one who had
talked to me so brilliantly at dinner. A third sat in the
candle-light—a very aged Hindu.... It is all very
memorable to me, Miss Cardinegh.”</p>

<p>Again and again he told the story, or parts of it, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
the woman; also of the doings of Routledge the next
morning, before the English came. Noreen thanked
him brokenly at last and hurried back to her father’s
state-room. Mr. Jasper saw very little of the lady during
the rest of the voyage, and lost her entirely at Shanghai,
where in stopping over he is left behind the movement
of the present narrative—a worthy, growing American
who will have much to tell his sister of Madras and
the interior, in spite of missing the illustrious Annie
Besant, pronounced “<i>Bes</i>sant” for esoteric reasons.</p>

<p>The incident was like oxygen to the tired woman.
Nearing Shanghai, the <i>Empress</i> steamer nosed the
winter zone, and Jerry Cardinegh was not well enough
to go ashore. Noreen had shopping to do, and took the
afternoon launch up the river for an hour in the city.
Snow was falling. On the Bund, Noreen encountered
Finacune, who had come down from Tokyo to get a
glance at affairs from the outside. He declared that
little or nothing was to be learned in the Japanese capital.
Already the nation was constructing an impenetrable
atmosphere about her great war. Finacune was going
back on the <i>Empress</i>. As the time was short, they
parted to attend their several errands, planning to meet
at the launch later.</p>

<p>With her parcels, Noreen hurried back from the shops
to the Bund in the winter twilight. Finacune, who had
not seen her, was fifty feet ahead, also making for the
water-front. She saw him stop short, stare for an
instant at the profile of a huge, gaunt figure—in the
great frieze coat! It was then that the mighty leap of
her heart forced a cry from her throat.... Routledge,
staring out over the darkening river, started at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
her voice and the touch of her hand. For a moment he
pressed his fingers against his eyes as if trying to shut
out some haunt from his brain. Then he, spoke slowly:</p>

<p>“I did not think that there were substances fine
enough in the world to make a woman so beautiful——”</p>

<p>“Routledge-san! Oh, God, there is only a moment
or two!”</p>

<p>“I should not have been here,” he began vaguely.
“Some one may see you talking with me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak of that!... Oh, words are such
puny things now! I thought we understood each other
about that. Tell me, are you ill? You look——”</p>

<p>“No, not ill, Noreen. I shall be tiptop when I get
up yonder into the field.... You startled me. I
think I was in a kind of dream about you, and then
you——” The old dread returned to his mind. He
wondered if the man who had passed had been Finacune.
“Are you alone? I wouldn’t have anybody see you
talking to me.”</p>

<p>All that was in her heart was called forth by the
spectacle of her giant’s pallor and seeming weakness.
Proudly she put all this into words:</p>

<p>“I would not care if the whole world saw me with
you. It is the same with me—as I told you on the way
to Charing Cross! What you may think—does not
make me afraid. You have done no wrong. I want to
be with you—but the time is not yet come. It is dreadful.
Why do you forget all that we told each other—all
that I told you?”</p>

<p>“I have not forgotten,” he said huskily. “The
scars of that hour in the carriage—leaving you that hour—would
not suffer me to forget, but I should not speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
this way. I wrong you speaking this way. I am only a
world-tramp between wars.... And this war I
must watch alone—from the edge where the others do
not go. God, what a coward I should be—to chance
your happiness——”</p>

<p>The launch whistled—a tearing in her brain. The
call to her father was instant and inexorable....
But she clung to Routledge—drew him to the very edge
of the stone-pier, blind to the glances of men and women
who brushed by.</p>

<p>“Quick, tell me of Jerry!” he said. “Is he out for
the war?”</p>

<p>“My father is dying a slow death out yonder on the
ship. I must go to him. Already he is dead to wars and
friends—all but dead to me!” She added imperiously,
“When my work is finished with him, I shall keep my
promise, Routledge-san. I shall come to you!”</p>

<p>“No—I’m going where you could not follow——”</p>

<p>“I shall find you!”</p>

<p>“But I have nothing between wars—no British press
now, Noreen—only a begging-bowl in India. Why, my
name is a whispered hate!... Just a begging-bowl
in India, Noreen—and your sweet faith in me.”</p>

<p>She was splendid in the ardor of her answer:</p>

<p>“That begging-bowl in India—I shall carry and share
with you! I shall take for mine—that name of whispered
hate!... Routledge-san, you have done no wrong—but
I should love you, if you led the armies of the
world—to burn London!”</p>

<p>He helped her aboard, as the bow was putting out
into the river. “In a time like this there are not big
enough words for you, Noreen Cardinegh.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“Oh, Routledge-san,—until I come, take care of your
life for me!” she called.... Then, fearless, full-voiced,
she added, standing in the snowy dusk: “And
when I come—I shall take care of your life for you—even
in the Leper Valley!”</p>

<p>He watched her through the big, slow-falling flakes,
until the launch disappeared behind the white stern of
an American gunboat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FIFTEENTH CHAPTER<br>

<small>NOREEN CARDINEGH APPEARS AFTER MIDNIGHT IN
THE BILLIARD-ROOM OF THE <i>IMPERIAL</i>—AN
INEFFABLE REMEMBRANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Finacune</span> caught a train for Tokyo, after disembarking
at Yokohama, an hour or two before the Cardineghs.
He wanted to prepare the way at the Imperial
for the coming of the dean and his daughter. It was
dark when he reached Shimbashi station and crossed the
<i>Ginza</i> to the now-famous hotel. Certain of the English
correspondents were gathered in the lobby, it being not
yet time to dress for dinner. These Finacune beckoned
to the billiard-room, and, standing at the head of the
farthest table, glanced over the faces to be sure that
none but the trusted British were present. Then he whispered
impressively:</p>

<p>“Scene: the Bund at Shanghai, snowy twilight; time,
five days ago. Looking out upon the darkening river,
‘... a face thin as a dead camel’s and yellow-white
like coral!’ That’s one of his own sentences, and
God pity or punish the sorrow of his face—as you
like——”</p>

<p>“Cut out the scenario,” ordered Bingley. “Who was
it?”</p>

<p>“The great frieze coat.”</p>

<p>Bingley was first to break the silence.</p>

<p>“Nice raw state of affairs,” he remarked savagely.
“I s’pose he has caught on with one of those fluttered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
newspapers of New York. They are grabbing up anybody
over here, even the remittance-men, so they won’t
have to pay expenses out. Rather raw deal, I call it,—to
be forced to ride with a traitor in this campaign.”</p>

<p>It was the austere Feeney who answered darkly,
“Recall, ‘Horse-killer,’ that Routledge rides alone.”</p>

<p>“I can’t see yet why the secret service doesn’t delegate
a man to <i>get</i> him,” Bingley whispered.</p>

<p>They had not heard that a venture of the kind had
failed at Madras.</p>

<p>“There is a time for all things,” Feeney replied.
“England never forgets a man like——”</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure of the face you saw?” inquired
Benton Day, the new man of the <i>Review</i>. His tone was
troubled. His work was cut out for him—to keep up
the war-reputation of the old paper of fat columns.</p>

<p>“Surely,” Finacune said cheerfully, “unless the
bottom dropped out of my brain-pan.”</p>

<p>Trollope sniffed ponderously, and was about to comment
when the little man of the <i>Word</i> resumed:</p>

<p>“Also, I am permitted to say—and this with a great
and sweet joy—that our dean, war’s own favorite, Jerry
Cardinegh, came up with me from Shanghai on the
<i>Empress</i>, and that he will be here to-night with his
daughter, Miss Noreen.”</p>

<p>The announcement was acclaimed.</p>

<p>“I heard he was coming,” said Feeney, “but how am
I to meet the old champion—me, holding down his old
chair-of-war on the <i>Witness</i>.”</p>

<p>“He’ll never think of it,” said Finacune. “Old
Jerry is nearly out of sight—over the bay. He didn’t
leave his state-room coming up—only let me see him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
once. His daughter is with him day and night. The
old man thought he’d like to get into the zone of war
once more—before he goes out on the last campaign,
where we all ride alone.”</p>

<p>It is to be observed that the little <i>Word</i> man did not
tell all he saw on the Bund at Shanghai.</p>

<p>The men repaired to the buffet to break the strain.
Those were heavy days—those early February days in
Tokyo. War was inevitable, but not declared. Tokyo
was sort of pleased at her own forbearance. The vaccine
of European civilization had worked with fullness
and dispatch. Here was proof: the Russian minister had
been allowed to clear, double-eyed and teeth still straight.
The mobs in the street did not profess to understand the
value of allowing the enemy to depart personally intact—but
it was being civilized. The world was watching the
young yellow nation’s first venture in <i>humane</i> war; after
which, if she conducted herself prettily, the world would
be pleased to admit her into the first flight of the powers,
where all things having to do with economy, polity,
expansion, revenue, and survival are done in a finished
fashion. England was watching—and stood behind her.
Japan must conduct herself in such a way as not to drag
England into the conflict.</p>

<p>Japanese infants played soldiers; Japanese policemen
played soldiers; rickshaw coolies, beneath the contempt
of a soldier, dreamed of future incarnations when
they should evolve into soldiers; Japanese merchants
snuffled, rubbed their damp hands together, and wept
internally because the Great Wheel of Fate had not
skited them off into the military class, instead of among
the low-brows of the shops. And the soldiers themselves—how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
they strutted and performed in the streets,
critically mirroring each other and bowing profoundly,
blind to all glory and sorrow not of the soldier, and
important as a grist of young doctors just turned loose
with their diplomas among the ills of the world....
Aye, funny and pitiful, the young Power looked in its
Western pants and guns.</p>

<p>What did England think—smiling back at the peace
of her Indian borders—of these wee, wet-nosed, scabby-headed
Islanders (with their queer little cruet-stands
buckled between their kidneys), in full cry with “Banzai
Niphon” from cape to cape? What England thought
was not what England said, as she reserved the front
pages of her daily press for Japanese victories—whether
or no. Not exactly an ally in spirit was wise old England,
but an ally in letterpress—the veriest Titan of a
press-agent.... Funny and pitiable indeed was
the ranting, tramping Japanese infantry in the streets of
Tokyo—funnier than stage infantry—quite like string-pulled
marionettes of <i>papier maché</i>; but let the truth be
told, the truth that rises clear from the final adjustment
of objects in the perspective: The oil of all the chlorates,
nitrates, and fulminates filled those queer little kidney-cruets;
and these same little Japanese infantrymen proved
packages—<i>papier maché</i> packages, if you like—of lyddite,
bellite, cordite, romite, hellite, and other boiled-down
cyclones.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On one of those ugly gray afternoons of early February,
Benton Day of the <i>Review</i> received a cablegram
from his chief in London, Dartmore. There are few men
who would express themselves ironically by cable at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
London-Tokyo rate of toll. Dartmore did it, and the
message follows, with flesh and organs added to the
cipher-skeleton:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The <i>Review</i> thought you would be interested to know that
Japan has declared war and smashed part of the Russian fleet.
This news from New York. Kindly inform Tokyo war-office,
which I understand is just a step from your hotel.</p>
</div>

<p>Benton Day had come up from common things by
strong, hard, well-planned work. He had known few
defeats, and these cut deeply. The cable from Dartmore
was the worst whipping of his career. Gray with shame,
he sought the billiard-room of the hotel, where he found
an animated group of British and American correspondents
who had just heard the news—ten hours after it
had been printed in London and New York. He found
that Dartmore alone had taken pains to be ironical in
the matter. The truth was exactly as ungetatable in
Tokyo as in Mombassa—until the war-office chose to
give it up. Benton Day was only to blame in so far as
he was not a telepathist. This knowledge eased him
greatly, but did not detract from his anger at Dartmore—an
emotion which is bad for a young man to take out on
his first big campaign. The little sentence in the cablegram
regarding the fact that London had received the
news from New York, held big interest for Feeney, the
saturnine.</p>

<p>“Japan was busy last night,” he communed. “Her
Mr. Togo smashed the Russians off Port Arthur, and
her little Mr. Uriu, off Chemulpo. It’s about time,” he
added with a trace of Indiana humor, “Japan was
declaring war. But the thing that gets me is, how did
New York know?... Finacune, my young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
friend, was it you who suggested something about the
great frieze coat catching on with New York papers?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Harrowing weeks at the Imperial followed, while
armies augmented, navies fought in the dark, and the
bearers of the light of the world made newspaper copy
out of heathen temples and Japanese street scenes. Free
lances fled to outer ports, there to hearken unto the tales
of refugees and weary the world. And the names of
these, the Japanese carefully ticketed to Failure, and
severed from Opportunity forever.</p>

<p>The Blue Boar, Trollope, wore best of all. He bathed
in many springs throughout the empire, peeked into
strange quarters of both capitals, and ate and drank
after the fashion of those who are formed of arcs and
not of angles. From time to time he cabled his paper
three words of hope, and eight words of expense account.
Trollope strolled down the menus in all parts of Niphon—native
and European menus—with fine relish, and waited
serenely for the time when he should lean and harden
in the field, his sleeves rolled up—one hand covering the
strategy of armies, the other at a cable-end, and his sweating
face reflecting the pink and pearly flush of fame.</p>

<p>It was not so with the others. Finacune was ragged
and restless. The pale Talliaferro looked twice for his
own shadow. Feeney’s dark fighting-face wasted and
hardened, until it seemed hewn from a block of brown
bone; and Trollope’s serene and changeless calm wrought
upon Bingley’s nerves like an active poison.</p>

<p>These two did not pretend to speak at the last. The
Horse-killer took on the look (his gray eyes were cold
and immutable as corner stones, anyway) as if he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
spur over a sea of dead men’s faces to get a big tale and
a free cable. It would not have been so bad except that
the London papers, coming in now with the first cables
of the correspondents, showed a consistent garbling and
distortion of their reports. Home writers occupied miles
of space, placed Togo along with Lord Nelson, and
Mutsuhito with Gladstone—a deep planned, conscienceless
campaign of fact-mutilation for the extolling of
Japanese character and mettle. New York, young in
war-handling, was inclined to follow London’s diplomatic
lead, against the reports of her own men. February and
March ended before the first batch of the British correspondents
were informed that they could take the field
with Kuroki’s first army.</p>

<p>Feeney and Finacune remained in the billiard-room
that last night at the Imperial, long after the rest had
gone. These two men had pulled apart from the others
in pulling together—the most florid with the dullest of
writers; the showiest with the deepest. It had been an
evening of rousing festivity. Possibly because these two
had drunk less than the others; or possibly because their
hopes for the field had been prolonged and mangled for
such a length of time that they could not sleep now until
they were actually booming down the Tokaido, Feeney
and Finacune were billiarding idly after one o’clock in
the morning and cooling the fever of the night’s stronger
spirits with long, chilled glasses of soda, lightly flavored
with Rhenish wine.</p>

<p>Jerry Cardinegh had come down for a moment early
in the evening for a word of parting. For days none
had seen him below; and only a few of his older friends
were admitted to the big, dim room, overlooking the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
park of the Government buildings—where a woman
lived and moved, lost to light and darkness, and struggled
every inch with the swift encroachments of the inevitable.
Noreen’s father relied upon her, as upon air and
a place to lie. God knows what vitality he drew from
the strong fountains of her life to sustain his last days.</p>

<p>Incessantly active, Noreen Cardinegh was worn to a
brighter lustre, as if fatigue brought out the fineness of
her human texture—a superlative woman who held her
place and her dreams. Finacune had loved her for years.
He was closer to her own romance than any of her
father’s friends; and the little man perceived with an
agony of which few would have thought him capable,
that his own chance was not worth the embarrassment
of telling her. Indeed, Finacune told no one. This was
his best room, and locked. Noreen Cardinegh was the
image there, beyond words, almost an abstraction. This
<i>Word</i> man was rather a choice spirit, if not a great one.
He was thinking of Noreen now, as he knocked the balls
around. She had appeared with her father earlier in
the night, and had stood behind him under the old
Moorish arch at the entrance to the billiard-room—darkness
behind her, and a low table-chandelier in
front....</p>

<p>Finacune was thinking, too, of the old man whom
she had helped down-stairs to say good-by to the boys.
Cardinegh had been his boyish ideal. He would not be
seen again—and what a ghastly travesty was his last
appearance!... Jerry had entered walking rigidly,
his limbs like wood, a suggestion of chaos in the shaking,
aimless hands; the shaven face all fallen about the mouth;
all the stirring history of an earth-wise man, censored and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
blotted from the flame-rimmed eyes; the temples blotched
with crimson and the mind struggling with its débris
like Gilliat against sea and sand and sky. And the
words the dean had uttered—nothings that meant death.</p>

<p>Feeney had just carefully and neatly made a three-cushion
carom, with the remark that he could do it again
on horseback, when there was a light, swift tread upon
the stairway, a rushing in the hall, light as a blown paper,
and Noreen Cardinegh burst upon them—half a torrent,
half a spirit, indescribable altogether. The souls of the
two men divined her message before she spoke, but
their brains were slower. And their eyes were startled.
To Finacune, it became an ineffable portrait—the frightened
face, white as pearl and set in gold; the dark silk
waist, unfastened at the throat; the red-gold hair dressed
and wound seemingly in Mother Nature’s winds; the
face refined in the whitest fires of earth; her eyes like
twin suns behind smoked glass; and the lips of Noreen—lips
like the mother of a prophet.</p>

<p>“Oh, come quickly!” she said, and was gone.</p>

<p>Finacune dashed up the stairway three at a stride,
but he never overtook her—a fact for profound speculation
afterward. She was bending over the edge of the
bed, sustaining her father, when he entered. Cardinegh
stared at him wildly for a second; then hearkened to
Feeney’s footsteps in the hall. When the latter entered,
the dean turned imploringly to his daughter.</p>

<p>“Where’s Routledge?” he gasped. “He said he’d
come back.”</p>

<p>A single jet of gas was burning in the big room.
With a nod of her head, Noreen signified for the men to
answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>“I haven’t heard from him, Jerry,” Feeney faltered.</p>

<p>“Eh, Gawd!—he’d better come quickly—or he won’t
see old Jerry. I’m going out—not with you, boys—but
afield. I want to see Routledge. He said he’d come
back and bring his book—done under the pressure of
British hate. I told you, didn’t I—he took the hate from
me?... I told Noreen.... Feeney! Finacune!...
It was I who gave the Russian spies the
Shubar Khan papers!... Don’t leave me, Noreen.
Pour me a last drink, Feeney.... Gawd! but I’ve
travelled in the shadow of death for two years—afraid—afraid
to tell—afraid of his coming back! I can see now—he
wouldn’t come back!... I’m not afraid now—but
I’ve had my hell two years.... You would
have found it in my papers, Noreen. Show them to the
men—cable the truth to London——”</p>

<p>“Jerry, Jerry,” whispered old Feeney, who was
stricken, “did Ireland get the best of you at the last?”</p>

<p>Finacune nudged him angrily. “Jerry,” he exclaimed,
“don’t go out with this stuff on your lips. We know
you’re doing it for Routledge——”</p>

<p>The woman turned upon him, but did not speak.</p>

<p>“I did it for Ireland—but it failed!” Cardinegh
answered. “These brown mongrels are fighting in Manchuria
the Russians that England should have fought on
the Indian border!... Eh, Gawd!—the dark has
been long a-liftin’, deere—but it’s gone—and you know
from me, without the papers!... Ah, Nory, child
of my heart——” He was straining upward toward her
face, as if he could not see her well. “... ’Tis
your mother—’tis your mother—I’m off, darlin’——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>“The old toast,” Feeney muttered. “It came true—the
toast we all stood to in Calcutta!”</p>

<p>The woman held but the ashes of a man in her arms,
and they drew her away at last. They thought from the
look of her face that she would fall, but she did not.
Instead, she said with sudden swiftness:</p>

<p>“Here are the papers. He told me all, just before I
called for you. I wanted you both to hear. It is true.
You must cable to-night to the war-office in London—to
the owners of your papers—to all those who know the
story. Then the secret service must be told—lest they do
Routledge-san further hurt. It must be done now. Tell
the other men to cable before they go out. I will cable,
too.... My father is guilty. We went back to
Tyrone before the Bhurpal trouble—to the little town
where he found my mother, in Tyrone. When he saw
the British troops quartered on that starving, sunken little
place—his mind gave way. He had the papers then,
which he gave afterward to the Russian spies!”</p>

<p>All this the woman spoke before she wept.</p>

<small>CERTAIN CIVILIANS SIT TIGHT WITH KUROKI, WHILE
THE BLOOD-FLOWER PUTS FORTH HER
BRIGHT LITTLE BUDS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> were in a troop-train at last, down the Tokaido,
the old cedar-lined highway of the <i>daimios</i>,—Feeney,
Finacune, Trollope, Bingley, other English and as many
more Americans. The road was a brown streak of troop-laden
trains off to embarkation ports. Japan was sending
out her willing wealth of men to a brown and sullen
land of such distances as would balk the short-sighted
Japanese eye, so used to toy sizes in all things—toy trees,
terraces, hills, and roads, whose ends are mostly in view.
These men were off to fight now in the outer court of
“the last and the largest empire, whose map is but half
unrolled.”</p>

<p>Bingley was sitting apart as usual, already in puttees
and Bedford cords, a blanket-roll underfoot and a light,
travelling type-mill in a leather-case by his side. Bingley
was brimming with the morbid, moody passion for
Bingley triumphs. A great type of the militant Englishman
this, with his stiff jaw and strong-seasoned blood,
utterly painless to almost everything but the spur of
ambition; identified peculiarly, penetratingly, with
Bingley and no other; the six feet of animal named
Bingley, in a soft shirt and Bingley cords. He was
sombrely glad this April morning to be started for the
field at last. Presently the <i>Thames</i>, London, the world,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
would hear the name of Bingley again—and the name
would mean a giant grappling with “monster heroisms”
in the midst of Asia and armies. The revelation and death
of Jerry Cardinegh the night before had a personal aspect
from Bingley’s point of view. It was that Routledge,
vindicated, would have a free hand again. He would
probably oust Benton Day from the <i>Review</i> and seek to
regain his old supremacy. Routledge would require lots
of handling, delicate and daring, to be downed and
dimmed.</p>

<p>To Feeney and Finacune, the events of the night
before had taken a place among the great military crises
of their experience. They had cabled the morning hours
away, as the other Englishmen had done, urged by the
woman. Indeed, the American correspondents were not
a little disturbed by the unwonted activity of the Londoners
at a time when, to them, all was done. What the
confession of Jerry Cardinegh meant to the English is
difficult adequately to express. Routledge had always
been <i>outré</i> and mysterious. The great treachery adjusted
itself to him with a degree of readiness, since it is easier
to identify a brilliant crime with an individual held loftily,
than with one in the more immediate reaches of the
public comprehension. But that old Jerry, their dean,
their master of many services, their idol and chief, should
have turned this appalling trick against the British arms
which he had helped to make famous—this was a heart-jolt
which bruised the twinings of a hundred sentiments.
Feeney was an Irishman, and could understand the
Cardinegh-passion, probably better than the others, but
he could not understand its expression in treachery. To
him there was only one explanation—madness....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>They discerned the Pacific from the Hankone mountains,
boomed through big, strange towns to Kyoto; then
Sasebo, the troop-ships, and the landing at a Korean base,
where they learned with bitterness that a second siege
of waiting had just begun. The world outside now was
but a wordless buzzing of voices, as from a locked room.
They were at Anju when the first brush happened at
Chengju (a neat little rout of Cossacks). They were at
Chengju when Kuroki occupied Wiju, regardless of the
growling of the Bear. They were at Yongampho, in the
last few hours of April, when Kuroki crossed the Yalu,
ten miles northeast, and fought the first great battle,
named after the river. Always it was this way—a day or
two’s march behind the business-end of the army.</p>

<p>It had been a dead delay in Tokyo; but it was a wait
lively with aggravations now—the wisp of fragrant hay
forever dangling in scent. An English military attaché
arriving late from Seoul brought the word that the cables
of the correspondents reached their papers from seven
to fifteen days late; and then with lineaments of the text
effaced by censorship—stale, egoless, costly messages.
At this word one of the American scribes crumpled under
the strain and went out into the Yellow Sea in a junk, a
mad dream in his brain to meet the sea-god, Togo, face
to face. Old Feeney, accustomed to discuss strategies
with generals, was spurred to such a distemper that he
cabled to be recalled. It is significant that his message
was the first of the war to go through the Japanese
censor untouched by the blue pencil.</p>

<p>Aye, and when the silent red stream of wounded
began to trickle back from the Yalu fight, it required a
man to keep himself reined down to a fox-trot. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
color, war-color, this back-throw from the weltering
fields. Even this stopped, and Kuroki seemed hung forever
in the hills about Fengwangcheng. The civilians
breathed hard those weeks, and lived in an atmosphere
burned from human rage. Always excepting Trollope,
the Blue Boar, who had a feeling for China. He studied
the deep, rutty Chinese roads through the hills (back of
the army), some of them worn into formidable ravines—eroded
by bare human feet and the showers of centuries.
There were strange little shrines and monasteries high
in those grim hills, and Trollope filled a note-book with
their names and history. There are strata of mystery
under the cuticle of China of which the raw young mind
of the white man can only conceive a tithe—and then
only in the ecstasy of concentration. And what names
he found—Road of the Purple Emperor; Spring of the
Whispering Spirit; Cascade of the Humming-bird’s
Wing; Cataract of the Sombre Clouds; Grotto of the
Adulteress’ Death—not names of mere flowery choosing,
but names made florid by the necessities of a people
whose history is so long that a poetic glamour has fallen
upon it. And the Blue Boar found much to eat of a
weird flavory sort, and kept his poundage.</p>

<p>What strategy was this which held a big, fat, pompous
army inactive through a golden month of campaigning
like this June? Bingley exclaimed that Kuroki was so
inflated by the Yalu victory that he was content to hunt
butterflies for the rest of the summer. The rumble of
real war reached the writers from time to time. Apparently,
the other Japanese generals were not like this gray-haired
Fabius—Kuroki of the first army. A man named
Oku, it was reported, had landed a second army at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
Pitsewo, half-way down the east coast of Liaotung, had
bored straightway across some devilishly steep passes
and cut off the fortress, Port Arthur, from the mainland.
The story of this fight was insufferable poison to the
white men with Kuroki. It had taken place on a narrow
neck of land, where sits high the town of Kinchow, joining
the little peninsula of the fortress to the big Liao
peninsula above. The rock-collared neck of land is
memorable now by a hill called Nanshan—the battle’s
name. Oku burned five thousand dead after the fight,
but he had cut off Port Arthur for the siege, and made
possible the landing of one Nogi with a third Japanese
army at Dalny—cheap at twice the price. Japanese gunboats
and torpedoes at sea on the west had helped Oku
get the strangle-hold on the neck of land, while a Russian
fleet had bombarded from the bay on the east. What
torture to believe this—that at last in the history of the
world armies and navies had met in a single action!
It was almost unthinkable to be camping with Kuroki in
the ancient Chinese hills, while such a panorama unfolded
for the eyes of other men—a battle such as the gods
would put on flesh to witness.</p>

<p>Finally the word was brought in by the Chinese, who
knew all things, that this jumping-bean, Oku, had left
the fortress to Nogi and the third army, and leaped north
to join a fourth army, under Nodzu, who had effected a
perfect landing at Takushan. Oku whipped poor
Stackelberg on the journey, Telissu being the historic
title of this incident of his flying march. Thus Yalu,
Nanshan, and Telissu were fought without even a smell
of smoke for Bingley, Feeney, Finacune, Trollope, and
others. It is to be noted that even Trollope blanched at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
the great war story the world missed by not letting him
in on Nanshan. That was one battle for a Tolstoi. The
English civilians sat together on a breezy, sweet-scented
hill and watched the sun go down on one of those June
evenings. Feeney was writing, the pad resting upon
his knee.</p>

<p>“What did you say was the name of your new
book?” Finacune inquired.</p>

<p>“‘Sitting Tight with Kuroki; or, The Wild Flowers
of Manchuria,’” grumbled the old man.</p>

<p>Into the group presently came Major Inuki, the
Japanese officer assigned to watch over the correspondents,
to see that none escaped, to see that none learned
anything but generalities, to furnish unlimited courtesy
and apologetic ramifications that stretched from Kirin
to Port Arthur. Inuki also supplied universes of unverifiable
information, having to do with vague Japanese
miracles and vast Russian casualties. He took off his
hat now and bowed all around, inhaled a long breath
with a hiss through his sparkling teeth, and snuffled
violently.</p>

<p>“It iss more dan quite possible we will remain here
for to-morr’, my dear fren’s. In such case would it not
be of good to instruk your servan’s to ereck the tents—more
stolidity?”</p>

<p>Feeney reached over and gravely clutched the flapping
trouser-leg of his Chinese coolie. “Jean Valjean,” he
said, “you are instruk to ereck tents—more stolidity.”</p>

<p>“Me plentee slabee,” said Jean.</p>

<p>The odor of supper was abroad in the camp of the
noncombatants, and the twilight was deep in the valley
of young corn. Feeney and Finacune ate in silence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
These two were closer together—close as only two male
adults can be who have lived long alone in broad areas,
sharing toil and irritation and peril; apart from women,
but akin in memories and ambition. Feeney had ridden
with the greatest of the nineteenth-century generals. He
was being herded now close to war, but out of range of
any good to his calling. He was thinking of Nanshan—what
a battle to have added to his string! Finacune was
thinking of the world’s greatest woman—how she had
come down like a spirit to the billiard-room that last
night in Tokyo—and with what exacting zeal she had
caused him and the others to cable away the last vestige
of glory from the name she bore.</p>

<p>“Blot up another piece of tea, Feeney,” he muttered,
“and cheer up.”</p>

<p>“I was just about to suggest, my vivid young friend,
that if you spilled any more gloom on this outfit, I should
burst into tears,” Feeney replied.</p>

<p>There was a long silence. “What?” said Feeney.</p>

<p>“I’m a hare-lipped cock-roach, if it isn’t wonderful!”
Finacune observed in an awed tone.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Suppose now—just now—suppose a white woman—all
in a soft summer gown and blowing golden hair—should
walk through this camp? Think of it!”</p>

<p>“I did—twenty years ago,” said Feeney.</p>

<p>“Think of it now,” Finacune persisted raptly, leaning
back against his saddle with a pot of tea in his hand.
“The mere sight of her would jam a sweetheart or a
wife, or both, into the brain of every man present—the
first kiss or a last, dim light somewhere, a word or a
caress—the unspeakable miracle that comes to every man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
some time—that of a woman giving herself to him!...
Ah, that’s it, you old crocodile! It would all
come back on live wires—if a woman walked through
here—to each man his romance—hot throats, dry lips,
and burning eyes. The world holds a woman for us all—even
for you, yoked to the war-hag; and if memories
were tangible, the right woman would sweep in upon
us to-night from five continents and seven seas. A
woman! The mere name is a pang to us lonely devils out
here in the open, where we blister with hate because we
are not allowed to smell blood. Hell!—one would think
I had just broken out of a gas-house.”</p>

<p>“Twenty years ago——” Feeney remarked.</p>

<p>“Hark, listen to that young American sing——”</p>

<p>“You listen to me, young man,” Feeney said forcefully.
“These lines, with which I am about to cleanse
you from carnality are by my young friend Kipling:</p>

<div class="verse">High hopes faint on the warm hearthstone—</div>
<div class="verse">He travels the fastest who travels alone.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“‘Sing the heretical song I have made,’” Finacune
added, entirely uncooled.... “I’ve heard fat London
club men expatiate for hours on what they might have
done if they hadn’t married—the beasts! They couldn’t
talk that way to us, sons of Hagar, out here in this
unsexed wilderness! I’d tell ’em what it would mean
to me—to be married to <i>one</i> woman! It would mean
more to me to be allowed to listen to whispered revelations
from one woman’s lips—than——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>“Dam’ you, quiet down!”</p>

<p>“Guess I better had.”</p>

<p>“Shall we have a hand at crib?” Feeney asked softly.</p>

<p>“Not now—please.”</p>

<p>There was a dusky splash of red in the sky beyond
the western hills, and a faint red foam above. The evening
was soft and sweet, and tobacco as fragrant as tropical
islands.</p>

<p>“Gad! I’m red-blooded,” Finacune murmured after
a moment. “I could squeeze milk out of a pound note.
I’d like to see a dog-fight. If there’s a man-fight to-morrow,
I’ll throttle Nookie-san, slide down into the
stoke-hold, and see how this new brand of fighter shovels
hell.”</p>

<p>“If you leave the woman behind,” Feeney grumbled,
“I’ll go with you.”</p>

<p>“A man is an awful animal—when he’s fit as I am,”
Finacune added. “The gang is certainly moonstruck
to-night. Listen to that ungodly American sun-spotter
sing.”</p>

</div></div>

<p>“That’s just the point—her star’ll be shining—only,
it may not,” Finacune whispered.</p>

<p>Feeney disdained to answer. Presently Major Inuki
appeared again and announced guilelessly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“Gentlema’—my dear fren’s, our gen’ral express
himself prepare to greet your illustrious peersonages—one
and every one—in his quarters at once. Would you
be deigned to follow my poor leadership?”</p>

<p>“Holy Father!—where’s my dress-suit?” Feeney
asked with a start.</p>

<p>“Such an honor does not increase our chances for
watching the next battle at close-range,” observed
Finacune.</p>

<p>Nookie-san led them through the dust past innumerable
battalions, until on a rising trail the sentries became
as thick as fire-flies. After a twenty-minute walk they
reached the summit of a commanding hill. At the
entrance of a large tent paper-lanterns were hung, and
below in the light Kuroki’s staff was gathered. Felicitations
endured for several moments; then an inspired hush
dominated all. The flap of the tent was drawn aside, and
a small, gray-haired man of stars emerged stiffly. His
eyes were bent toward the turf and thus he stood motionless
beneath the lanterns for several seconds.</p>

<p>“General Kuroki,” spoke Inuki in a low voice.</p>

<p>The general raised his eyes for just an instant—great,
tired, burning, black eyes with heavy rolled lids—bowed
slightly, then backed into the tent.</p>

<p>“Now, there’s a man with no carnal lust in him,”
Feeney commented to his companion. “He has commanded
his wife and family not to write him from Japan,
lest their letters distract attention from his work at
hand.”</p>

<p>“And he drowned a thousand men crossing the Yalu,”
remarked Finacune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>Bingley passed them with the remark, “I wonder if
God has the dignity of Kuroki?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Long afterward, when silence and stars lay upon the
hills, there was still a low whispering in the tent of
Feeney and Finacune.</p>

<p>“I wonder where the great frieze coat is this night?”
came with a yawn from the old man.</p>

<p>“God knows,” Finacune replied. “Alone in the dark
somewhere—unearthing great tales to be printed under
a strange name. If any one finds them, it will be Dartmore,
and his roots will wither because they are not in
the <i>Review</i>. Or——” The little man halted suddenly.
He had been about to add that a woman was apt to find
them. Instead he said, “Alone in the dark somewhere,
hiding from the wrath of the world—unless somebody’s
hunted him down to tell him that he’s clean and desirable
again.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see the great frieze coat this night,” said
Feeney in a listless tone, as if he had not listened to the
other.</p>

<p>“I’d like to have been the one—to find him for her.”</p>

<p>“There never was a nobler thing done for a woman—than
Routledge did,” the old man went on, after a pause.</p>

<p>“There never was a nobler woman,” breathed the
florid one.</p>

<small>FEENEY AND FINACUNE ARE PRIVILEGED TO
“READ THE FIERY GOSPEL WRIT IN
BURNISHED ROWS OF STEEL”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> a matter of fact, Kuroki was only waiting for
Oku and Nodzu to join him in the great concentration
upon Liaoyang under Oyama. This battle was planned
to finish the Russians in the field, as Togo was to do
at sea, and Nogi in the Fortress. Roughly, the Japanese
now stretched across the peninsula from the mouth of
the Liao to the mouth of the Yalu—a quarter of a million
men with eyes on Liaoyang—Kuroki on the right, Nodzu
in the centre, Oku on the left. Oyama polished his
boots and spurs in Tokyo, preparing to take his rice and
tea in the field as soon as it was heated to the proper
temperature.</p>

<p>Late in June, Kuroki awoke and began to spread like
a gentle flow of lava, filling the hither defiles of the great
Shanalin range, making ready to take the stiff and dreadful
passes which the Russians had fortified as the outer
protection of Liaoyang. Right here it must be interpolated
that Bingley had cut Kuroki for Nodzu’s fourth
army a few days before, when the two forces had touched
wings for a day. The “Horse-killer” was scarcely gone
before Kuroki encountered one of the toughest and
pluckiest foes of his stupendous campaign, General
Kellar, who gave him terrific fights at Fenshui and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
Motien passes, and tried to take them back after they
were lost. Again at Yansu, a month later, the doughty
Kellar disputed the last mountain-trail to the city, and
Kuroki had to kill him to get through.... The
army was growing accustomed to the civilians, and these
were days of service for the correspondents. It was
given them now to see the great fighting-machine of
Kuroki—that huge bulk of flying power—lose its pomp
and gloss and adjust itself to the field. It faded into the
brown of the mountains, took on a vulpine leanness and a
nerveless, soulless complacence, like nothing else in the
world. Food was king; fighting was the big-game sport;
toil was toil, and death was not the least of benefits. It
was now August, and Kuroki’s part in the Liaoyang
preliminaries finished. A month later the battle was on....
In the gray morning light of the twenty-ninth
of August, the sound of distant batteries boomed over
the Shanalin peaks to the ears of the correspondents.
Finacune leaped up with a cry:</p>

<p>“Liaoyang is on! And what are we doing away off
here?”</p>

<p>“Smokin’ our pipes in the mountings,” Feeney
answered huskily, reaching for a match, “‘an’ breathin’
the mornin’ cool.’”</p>

<p>“We’re lost,” Finacune declared bitterly. “I can
hear the London experts howling, ‘Where’s Kuroki and
his lost army?’”</p>

<p>“Lost, is it? Hush! Come near me, young man.
We’re lost, but destined to appear in good time,” Feeney
whispered. “I’ll bet you an oyster-stew to a dill-pickle
that we are the flankers. We’re relegated off here to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
cross the river when the moon’s right, and to bore in at
the railroad behind the city, while Oyama and Kuropatkin
are locking horns in front.”</p>

<p>Old Feeney, wise in war, had hit upon the strategy
before the others; although any expert familiar with the
terrain would thus have planned the taking of the city.
That night Kuroki camped on the south side of the
Taitse; and on the morning of the second day following
was across with seventy thousand men. This by the
grace of a corps of insignificant-looking engineers, busy
little brown chaps who worked a miracle of pontooning—conquered
a deep and rushing river without wetting
a foot in Kuroki’s command. There had been rains, too,
and between the showers, far salvos of cannon rode in
from the west on the damp, jerky winds.</p>

<p>There is no place so good as here to drop a conventional
figure of the Liaoyang field. The strategy of the
battle is simple as a play in straight foot-ball. Japanese
and Russian linesmen are engaged in a furious struggle
south and southeast of the city. Imagine Kuroki, the
Japanese half-back, breaking loose with the ball and
dashing around the right end (crossing the Taitse River)
and boring in behind toward the Russian goal—the railroad.
This threatens the Russian communications. If
the Russian full-back, Orloff, cannot defend the goal,
the whole Russian line will be jerked up and out of the
city to prevent being cut off from St. Petersburg. This
leaves the field and the city to the Japanese. Here is the
simplest possible straight line sketch of the city, river,
railroad, and the position of the fighters when the battle
began; also, shown by the arrow, the sweep of Kuroki’s
now-famous end-run. [See drawing on next page.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>The midnight which ended August found the intrepid
flanker launched straight at the Russian railroad at the
point called the Yentai Collieries, nine miles behind the
city.</p>

<p>“We’re locked tight in the Russian holdings this
minute,” Finacune whispered, as he rode beside the grim
veteran.</p>

<p>“Where did you think we were—on some church
steps?” Feeney asked.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe48_9375" id="i_225">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_225.jpg" alt="Kuroki’s now-famous end-run">
</figure>

<p>It looked a dark and dangerous game to the dapper
little man. The lure of action, so strong at Home, often
turns cold at the point of realization. Finacune had the
nerves which are the curse of civilization, and he felt the
chill white hand of fear creeping along these sensitive
ganglia just now in the dark.</p>

<p>“I haven’t a thing against Kuropatkin—only I hope
he is a fool for a night,” he observed presently. “Somehow,
I don’t feel cheerful about the fool part. He <i>must</i>
hear us tramping on his back door-steps this way. Why
can’t he spare enough men from the city to come out here
and sort of outflank the flanker?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>“That’s just his idea,” Feeney replied, “but don’t
forget that Oyama will keep him so dam’ busy below
that it will be hard for him to match us man for man and
still hold on. However, remember he’s got the position,
and he won’t need to match the Japanese—quite.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Kuropatkin’s far-flung antennæ
had followed Kuroki well. The Russian chief, knowing
the strength of his front position on the city, had determined
to slip back and crush Kuroki with an overwhelming
force, leaving only two corps of Siberians, under
Zurubaieff, to hold off Nodzu and Oku from the inner
defenses of Liaoyang. General Orloff, who was in command
at the Yentai Collieries, where Kuroki’s flanking
point was aimed, was under orders to attack the Japanese
in flank at the moment Kuropatkin’s main force appeared
to hit the Japanese in full. There was the constant roar
of big guns in Orloff’s ears in that dawning of September
first—a rainy dawn. Also his own troops were moving
along the railroad. Another thing, there had been a
vodka-train broken into the night before by his own men.</p>

<p>Orloff thought he saw Kuropatkin coming, and set
out prematurely. Kuroki was concealed in the fields of
ripe millet, and turned to the work of slaughter with
much enthusiasm, wondering at the weakness of the
enemy. This slaughter of Orloff, which lost the battle
for the Russians, Feeney and Finacune saw.</p>

<p>“There’s eighteen burnt matches in your coat pocket,
my young friend,” said Feeney, “and your pipe would
light better if you put some smokin’ in it—in the bowl,
y’know. For what do you save the burnt matches?”</p>

<p>Finacune grinned shyly. “Wait till the fire starts—I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span> 
be warmer. I’m always like this at first—like the
little boy who tried to cure bees with rheumatism.”</p>

<p>“Something’s wrong with the Russians,” Feeney
declared in low excitement. “We should all be dead by
this time—if they are going to whip Kuroki. Oh, war—war
is a devil of a thing!” he added flippantly. “We’re
crushing the farmers’ grain.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you fire-eater. Haven’t you any reverence?
I’m preparing myself for death.”</p>

<p>That instant they heard a low command from an
unseen Japanese officer, and a long drawn trumpet-cry.
The Japanese leaped up from the grain. All was a
tangle. Feeney, grabbing Finacune’s arm, seized the
moment to break from Major Inuki and the others, and
rushed forward to the open with the infantry.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he said excitedly. “We’re foot-loose!
Come on, my little angel brother, and play tag with these
children!... ‘Onward, Christian Soldiers!’”</p>

<p>Never a wild rose of boyhood smelled half so sweet
to Finacune as the ancient soil of Asia that moment, but
he was whipped forward by certain emotions, to say nothing
of Feeney and the avalanche of Japanese. They
reached the edge of the grain and met the first gust of
Orloff’s rifle steel. Down they went for the volleys, and
that moment perceived a most amazing trick of a shell.
A little knot of ten Japanese were running forward just
before them when there was a sudden whistling shriek.
The ten were lost for a second in a chariot of fire. When
it cleared only one Japanese remained standing.</p>

<p>“That Russian gunner bowled a pretty spare,” grimly
observed Feeney. “Come, get up, lad. The volleys are
over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>“Not this Finacune. I’m not short-sighted. I’m
going to hold fast to this sweet piece of mainland just
now. Besides——”</p>

<p>The little man burst into a nervous laugh and glanced
at his foot. Then he stiffened into a sitting posture.
Feeney looked him over. His hat was gone, scalp bleeding,
his shirt-sleeve burst open as if it had been wet
brown paper, and the sole of his left shoe torn away
clean.</p>

<p>“Queer about that shrapnel,” he mumbled. “I’m
interested in shrapnel anyway. I haven’t got any more
toe-nails on that foot than a bee.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kuroki was crushing the Orloff member
with a force destined to wreck the whole Russian
nervous-system. Out of the grain he poured torrents of
infantry which smote the Russian column in a score of
places at once.</p>

<p>“Did you ever put your ear to the ground during a
battle, Feeney?” the other asked wistfully. “It sounds
aw’fly funny—funnier than sea-shells. Let’s try.”</p>

<p>Feeney did not answer. He was watching the disorder
which swept over the Russian lines. It had changed
into a deluge tossing back toward the Collieries. There
was a fury even in the clouds of powder smoke that
seemingly had nothing to do with the winds. They
darted, stretched, and tore apart from the whipped-line
with some devilish volition of their own.</p>

<p>“There’ll be excitement presently,” the veteran
remarked.</p>

<p>The other had risen and was clutching his arm, his
bare foot lifted from the ground. He was properly
stimulated by the action, but kept up a more or less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
incessant chattering, his brain working as if driven by
cocaine.</p>

<p>“Ex—excitement! This is a sedative, I believe.
Let’s lie down, you bald-headed fatalist——”</p>

<p>“Don’t dare to. Look at your foot. Dangerous
below. Ricochets hug the turf.... Livin’ God!
they’re going to throw out cavalry upon us! They’re
going to heave cavalry against Kuroki’s point! Bloom
up, little man. Here’s where the most nerveless of the
white races smite the most nervous of the yellow—and
on horses!”</p>

<p>“I’m bloomin’ on one foot,” said Finacune.</p>

<p>Kuropatkin, apprised of Orloff’s error, was thundering
his divisions up the railroad at double-time toward
the Collieries, but, despairing to reach the blundering
Orloff in time, had ordered his cavalry railway-guards to
charge the enemy.... They came on now with
mediæval grandeur, a dream of chivalry, breaking through
gaps of Orloff’s disordered infantry—to turn the point of
the Japanese flanker. Splendid squadrons!... A
curse dropped from Feeney’s gray lips.</p>

<p>“They’re going to murder the cavalry to put red
blood into that rotten foot-outfit,” he said.</p>

<p>Finacune’s face was colorless. He did not answer.
The sound of bullets in the air was like the winging of a
plague of locusts. Often the two huddled together, allowing
a gasping battalion to leap past them toward the
front. Kuroki was breaking his command into fragments
and rolling them forward like swells of the sea.
His front-rankers dropped to their knees to fire; then
dashed forward a little way to repeat—all with inhuman
precision. Feeney’s field-glass brought out their work.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
In a mile-long dust-cloud, the Russian cavalry thundered
forward like a tornado.</p>

<p>The Cossacks swept into Kuroki’s zone of fire.
Feeney heard his companion breathe fast, and turned his
head. The <i>Word</i> man was staring into the heart of the
Cossack charge, his fears forgotten, fascinated unto madness.
The earth roared with hoofs, and the air was rent
with guns. On came the cavalry until it reached Kuroki’s
point and halted it; but upon the Cossacks now from
the countless Japanese skirmish-lines were hurled waves
of flying metal—waves that dashed over the Russian
horsemen as the sundered seas rushed together upon
Pharaoh’s hosts.</p>

<p>“It’s like a biograph,” came from Finacune.</p>

<p>Kuroki was checked; his van ridden down. The Russian
horse, cumbered with its dead, and taking an enfilading
fire from half the Japanese command, was now
ordered to retire. Only the skeletons of the glorious
squadrons obeyed. Kuroki was stopped indeed—stopped
to thrust an impediment aside. He rose from his knees,
fastened a new point to his plow, and bored in toward
the railway upon the strewn and trampled grain-fields.
Already the hospital corps was gathering in the endless
sheaves of wounded.</p>

<p>“One can tell the dead by the way they lie,” Finacune
said vaguely. “They lie crosswise and spoil the
symmetry.”</p>

<p>Orloff was steadied a trifle by the cavalry sacrifice,
and turned an erratic but deadly fire upon the Japanese....
At this instant Major Inuki pounced upon the
two correspondents and carried them back toward headquarters.
He made very many monkey-sounds; was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
quite unintelligible from excitement; in fact, at the
thought of these two being suffered to see so much alone.
If their heads had been cameras, straightway would
they have been smashed....</p>

<p>Practically they had seen it all. Kuroki’s work for
that September day was done. Shortly after the retirement
of the cavalry, he received a dispatch from Oyama
saying that Kuropatkin had ordered a general retreat.
Kuroki’s end-run had won the battle for Oyama; Orloff
had lost it for Kuropatkin. The latter, perceiving the
havoc at the Collieries when he came up with his big
force, decided not to attack the victorious flanker.
Instead, he set out for Mukden, and commanded Zurubaieff,
the rear-guard, to pull up out of the city, cross
the Taitse, and burn his bridges behind him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“He’s quite a little ornament-merchant, this Kuroki,”
Finacune observed that afternoon, holding a very sore
foot in his hands.</p>

<p>“He’d put out hell—he’s too cold to burn,” replied
Feeney.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">EIGHTEENTH CHAPTER<br>

<small>BINGLEY BREAKS AWAY FROM THE CAMP OF THE
CIVILIANS TO WATCH “THE LEAN-LOCKED
RANKS GO ROARING DOWN TO DIE”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Feeney and Finacune were flanking with
Kuroki, the “Horse-killer” was with Nodzu, whose business
it was to charge the Russian centre before Liaoyang.
Bingley had not shifted commands without a good
reason. He had made up his mind to get to an uncensored
cable after the battle was over, and Nodzu was
nearer the outlet of the war-zone. Moreover, it was said
that the civilian contingent with Nodzu was not subjected
to the smothering system, quite to the same extent
as that with the flanker, Kuroki.</p>

<p>Nodzu, himself, did not appeal to Bingley. He
seemed like a nice, polite little person of the sort the
“Horse-killer” had observed serving behind curio-counters
in Tokyo. His voice was light, and his beard wasn’t iron-gray.
Bingley remarked that a marooned painter would
have a hard time gathering a pastelle-brush from Nodzu’s
beard, and he noted with contempt that the general spoke
drawing-room Japanese to his staff. The generals whom
Bingley respected, roared. They not only split infinitives,
but they forked them with flame.</p>

<p>All three officers under Field-Marshal Oyama—Kuroki
flanking on the right, Nodzu bearing in on the
Russian centre, and Oku pushing up the railroad on the
left—had to fight their way to the positions from which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
the three finally took the city. Many lesser towns and
some very difficult passes were picked up on the way.
For instance, Oku, the left blade of the crescent, who
was being watched by the chief male figure in this narrative
(as Bingley was watching Nodzu), changed the
flags at Kaiping, Tashekao, and Newchwang on the way,
Chinese towns of filth and fatness; and shoved before
him in an indignant turkey-trot Generals Stackelberg
and Zurubaieff.</p>

<p>Baking hot weather, and Liaoyang ahead! Nogi was
thundering behind at the fortress of Port Arthur; Togo
was a red demon in smoky crashing seas; blood of the
Bear already smeared the Sun flag, and the blood-flower
was in bloom in Manchuria.</p>

<p>Bingley felt the floods of hate stir and heat within
him on the morning of August twenty-fourth, when over
the hills from the right, which was eastward, sounded
the Beginning—Kuroki in cannonade. Feeney and Finacune
had had the luck to beat him to real action. The
next day Oku took up the bombardment on the left. It
was not until the following morn that Nodzu leaped to
his guns, and the hot winds brought to the nostrils of
the “Horse-killer” the pungent breath of powder.</p>

<p>The correspondents were held back in the smoke as
usual. Five months in the field, and they had not yet
caught up with the war. Again, on the second day of
Nodzu’s action, the correspondents were left behind
under a guard who was extremely courteous. This was
more than white flesh could bear. The civilians implored,
demanded. It was remarkable that Bingley did not mix
strongly in this rebellion. He was planning carefully,
desperately, to be in at the end, and showed the courage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
to wait. He realized that the battle was far from ended
yet; even though Kuroki was mixing hand-to-hand in
the east, Oku in the west closing in over barriers of
blood, and Nodzu in the centre engaged daily with a
ten-mile front of duelists—a bare-handed, hot-throated
fiend, chucking his dead behind him for elbow-room.</p>

<p>Bingley studied maps and strategy—not from Nodzu’s
standpoint alone, but from the whole. What would he
do if he were Field-Marshal Oyama?</p>

<p>The theatre of war was dark on the morning of
August twenty-ninth, but in mid-afternoon Nodzu began
firing—firing at nothing! He stood still and belched
thunder, as if it were something to be rid of; ripping
open the very kernels of sound, and making the summer
afternoon no fit place for butterflies. Bingley’s eyes were
very bright. This tallied with one of his hypotheses.
It was a demonstration, under the cover of which his
old friend Kuroki was to start a flanking movement.</p>

<p>That night the smileless young giant worked long in
his tent. Stretched full-length upon his blankets, a
lantern by his side, he wrote hard in his note-books and
drew maps of the flying flanker, whom Feeney and
Finacune were now following. He showed these maps,
all dated to the hour, in London afterward, with the
remark that he had divined the strategy of Liaoyang
before the battle.</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch, at last, and at his field outfit,
which was all packed and in order. Then he slept until
dawn. No one slept after that, since Nodzu was up
with the first light, like a boy with a new cannon on the
morning of the Fourth. Bingley was missed at breakfast.
His Korean coolies knew nothing, except that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
had been ordered to take care of the Bingley property
and wait for orders. The “Horse-killer” had made a
clean departure with a good mount and nothing but his
saddle-bags. Still, no one fathomed his audacity. Confidently,
it was expected that he would be returned in
short order by some of the Japanese commanders who
happened to read the civilian insignia flaring upon his
sleeve. As a matter of fact, Bingley quickly would have
been overhauled had he not brooded so long and so well
upon the time. The middle Japanese army was too busy
that morning to think of one daring civilian.</p>

<p>Bingley’s plan was this: To watch what he could of
the battle, unfettered, making his way gradually westward
behind Oku until the end, or until such time as
he mastered the color and saw the end; then to ride
alone down the railroad, nearly to Fengmarong; there
to leave his horse, cross the Liao River, and travel on
foot down to Wangcheng. He planned to catch the
Chinese Eastern at Wangcheng and make the day’s
journey to Shanhaikwan beyond the Wall, where the
Japanese could not censor his message. In a word,
Bingley’s plan was to stake all on reaching a free cable
before any other man, and to put on that cable the first
and greatest story of the greatest battle of the war.</p>

<p>That was a day in which Bingley truly lived. A mile
behind Nodzu’s reserve, he spurred his horse down into
a tight darkened ravine, and tethered the beast long to
crop the pale grass blades thinly scattered throughout
the sunless crevasse. Marking well the topography of
the place, so that he could find it again in anything but
darkness, Bingley moved back toward the valleys of
action. Nodzu was hammering the impregnable Russian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
position before the city from the hills, and charging
down at intervals great masses of infantry to hold the
main Russian force in their intrenchments before the
city, and thus to prevent the Russian general from sending
back a large enough portion of his army to crush or
outflank the Japanese flanker.</p>

<p>Noon found Bingley still at large and across a big
valley, now almost empty of troops. He was forced to
cross one more ridge to command the battle-picture.
This required a further hour, and he sat down to rest
upon the shoulder of a lofty, thickly timbered hill which
overlooked the city for which the nations met—a huge,
sprawled Chinese town, lost for moments at a time in
the smoke-fog. The river behind was obscured entirely;
still, the placing of the whole battle array was cleared to
him in a moment. All his mapping and brooding had
helped him marvelously to this quick grasp of the field.
He wished that he could cable the picture of the city,
the river, the railroad, the hills, just as he saw them
now—so that London might also see through Bingley
eyes. As for the rest—Nodzu’s great thundering guns
and his phantom armies moving below in the white
powder-reek—he could write that....</p>

<p>“But I’ve got to get a strip of real action—I’ve got
to see the little beasts go,” he muttered at length. “It’s
a long chance, but I’ve got to get a touch of the blood-end—to
do it right. It is as necessary as the lay of
the land.”</p>

<p>And down he went, forgetting fear and passing time,
even during certain moments, forgetting the outer world
that would cry, “Bingley! Bingley!” when he was
through.... Deeper and deeper he sank into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
white mist of smoke which five minutes before had been
torn by flame and riven with rifle crashes.</p>

<p>It was a moment of lull between Nodzu’s infantry
charges. A land current of air cleared the low distance.
The southern line of intrenched Russian infantry looked
less than a mile away. Behind them, the land was pitted
and upheaved with defenses to the very wall of the city,
having the look, as Bingley observed, as the wind swiftly
cleared away the smoke, of the skin of a small-pox convalescent.
There was no sign of life in the Russian
works, but his quick eye marked that shrapnel was
emplaced on the higher mounds.... Had he lived
a thousand years for the single purpose of viewing a
battle—hundreds of acres of embattled thousands straining
in unbridled devilment; a valley soaked and strewn
with life essences, yet swarming with more raw material
for murder—he could not have judged his advent better.
It was the thirtieth of August—the day that Nodzu and
Oku began their un-Christly sacrifices to hold Kuropatkin
in the city and in front, while Kuroki flanked.</p>

<p>Suddenly—it was like a tornado, prairie fire, and stampede
rolled into one—Nodzu of the pastelle-brush beard
called up his swarm from thicket, hummock, gulley, ditch,
from the very earth, and launched it forward against the
first blank ridge of the Russians. This brown cyclone
tore over Bingley of the <i>Thames</i> and across the ruffled
valley. The “Horse-killer” sat in awe. There was not
yet a shot. The Russian trenches had the look of
desertion.</p>

<p>“Hell!” he snapped viciously. “Those trenches
are abandoned. Kuropatkin might as well be cooling his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
toes in Lake Baikal for all Nodzu will find there, and he’s
rushing as if——”</p>

<p>At this instant the Russian works were rubbed out of
vision in a burst of white smoke, and the sound of Russian
bullets was like the swooping of ten thousand night-hawks....
A terrific crash, a blast of dust, burnt
powder, filings, sickening gases—and that which a
moment ago was a dashing young captain with upraised
sword was now wet rags and dripping fragments of pulp.</p>

<p>“Shrapnel,” said Bingley. “He’s happy now. He
was playing to a gallery of Samurai saints—that little
officer.... Nervy devils all—never doubt it....
But we’re walloped—walloped sure as hell. We can
never take those works.”</p>

<p>The position of the enemy was now obscured by
trembling terraces of white smoke, out of which poured
countless streams of death, literally spraying Nodzu’s
command, as firemen play their torrents upon a burning
building. A rat couldn’t have lived out a full minute in
the base of that valley. The Japanese left a terrible
tribute, but the few sped on and upward to the first line
of Russian entrenchments. A peculiar memory recurred
to Bingley. Once in London he had seen a runaway team
of huge grays attached to a loaded coal-cart. The tailboard
of the cart jarred loose, and the contents streamed
out behind as the horses ran. So the hard-hit streamed
out from the Japanese charge as it passed over the base
of the valley.</p>

<p>Even as the maddest of the Japanese survivors were
about to flood over the first embankment, it was fringed
with bayonets as a wall with broken glass; and along the
length of the next higher trenches shot a ragged ring of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
smoke—clots of white strung like pearls.... As a
train boring into a mountain is stopped, so was Nodzu’s
brown swarm halted, lifted, and hurled back.</p>

<p>“The little brown dogs!” observed Bingley with joyful
amazement. “Why, they’d keep the British army
busy!... And they smile, dam’ ’em—they smile!”</p>

<p>This last referred to the dead and wounded which
the hospital corps was now bringing back....
From out of the welter, a new charge formed and failed.
Again—even Bingley was shaken by the slaughter and
his organs stuck together—Nodzu hurled a third torrent
of the Samurai up that unconquerable roll of earth. It
curled like a feather in a flame, diminished, and faltered
back....</p>

<p>The day was ending—Bingley’s gorgeous, memorable
day. He had travelled twenty-five miles on foot; he had
caught up with the Japanese army after five months in
the field; he had seen Nodzu charge and Zurubaieff hold;
he had seen the wounded who would not cry, and the
dead who would not frown.</p>

<p>The whole was a veritable disease in his veins. The
day had burned, devoured him. He was tired enough
to sleep in a tree, chilled from spent energy; so hungry
that he could have eaten horn or hoof; but over all he
was mastered by the thought of Bingley and his work—the
free cable, the story, the <i>Thames</i>, the battle, Bingley,
the first and greatest story, acclaim of the world, the
world by the horns! So his brain ran, and far back in
his brain the films of carnage were sorted, filed, and
labelled—living, wounded, dead; the voices of the Japanese
as they ran, Russian-pits from which death spread,
shrapnel emplacements which exploded hell; barbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
entanglements spitting the Japanese for leisure-slaying,
as the butcher-bird hangs up its living meat to keep it
fresh for the hunger-time; the long, quick-moving, burnished
guns that caught the sun, when the smoke cleared,
and reflected it like a burning-glass—such were the
details of the hideous panorama in Bingley’s brain.</p>

<p>The chief of his troubles was that Liaoyang still held.
He had always laughed at the Russians, and looked forward
to the time when he should watch the British beat
them back forever from India. The valor of the stolid,
ox-like holding angered him now. Suppose Liaoyang
should not be taken! It would spoil his story and hold
him in the field longer than he cared to stay. He had
but scant provisions for two days. He planned to be off
for the free cable to-morrow night.</p>

<p>“It’s going to rain,” he gasped, as he let himself down
at nightfall into his ravine. He heard the nicker of the
horse below. It did not come to him with any spirit of
welcome, for Bingley was sufficient unto himself, but with
the thought that he must keep the beast alive for the
race to the cable after the battle.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s going to rain,” he repeated. “You can
count on rain after artillery like to-day.... Living
God! I thought I knew war before, but it was all sparrow-squabbling
until to-day!”</p>

<p>He found his saddle-bags safely in the <i>cache</i> where
he had left them—this with a gulp of joy, for the little
food he had was in them. Crackers, sardines, a drink of
brandy that set his empty organism to drumming like
a partridge. It also whetted his appetite to a paring
edge, but he spared his ration and smoked his hunger
away. Then in the last drab of day, and in the rain, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
cut grasses and branches, piling them within the reach of
his horse. A stream of water began to trickle presently
down the rocks when the shower broke. Bingley drank
deeply, and caught many <i>ponchos</i> full afterward for his
mount. Later he fell asleep, shivering, and dreamed that
the devil was lashing the world’s people—a nation at a
time—into pits of incandescence. The savagery of the
dream aroused him, and he became conscious of a strangeness
in his ears. It was the <i>silence</i>, and it pained like
rarefied air. Wet, stiffened, deathly cold, he fell asleep
again.</p>

<p>The next day, the thirty-first, and the worst of the
battle, Bingley curved about Oku’s rear to the railroad
which marked for him a short cut to the outer world.
Another, that day, watched Oku closely as he forced the
Russian right wing to face the Japanese, but Bingley,
even from a distance, was charged and maddened by the
dynamics of the action....</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, a little to the west of the railway,
he stopped to finish his food and gather forage for
his horse, when over the crest of a low hill appeared a
tall human figure. The Japanese put no such giants in the
field, and Bingley was startled by a certain familiarity
of movement.</p>

<p>The man approached, a white man. Chill, weakness,
and hatred welled suddenly in Bingley’s veins. He was
not alone on the road to a free cable. The man he feared
most in the world was entered in the race with him—the
man he had seen last at the Army and Navy reception,
and roughed and insulted, nearly three years
before.</p>

<p>Routledge smiled, but spoke no word. Bingley regarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
the strong, strange profile, haggard, darkened as
a storm arena. He saddled savagely and rode after the
other. It was fifty-five miles to Wangcheng, where he
meant to catch the <i>Chinese Eastern</i> for Shanhaikwan
to-morrow morning—fifty-five miles in the dark, over
rain-softened roads.</p>

<p>“Hell! he can’t make it on foot,” Bingley muttered.
“I’ll beat him to the train.”</p>

<p>And yet he was angered and irritated with the reflection
that the man ahead had never yet been beaten.</p>

<small>NOREEN CARDINEGH, ENTERING A JAPANESE HOUSE
AT EVENTIDE, IS CONFRONTED BY THE VISIBLE
THOUGHT-FORM OF HER LOVER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Noreen Cardinegh</span> buried her father alone. At least,
those besides herself who took any part in the last service
for the famous correspondent were only Japanese hired
for the manual labor. To the English who were still at
the hotel, eager to assist the woman, and charged to do
so by Feeney, Finacune, and Trollope before they left,
the morning was sensational. In spite of the fact that
scarcely any one had been admitted to the Cardinegh room
for the past two days, Talliaferro and others had arranged
for the funeral. They were abroad at nine o’clock in the
morning, and found the formality over.... The
Japanese clerk told them all. At her request, he had
made arrangements with a Tokyo director of such affairs.
The body had been taken out at dawn. Miss Cardinegh
had followed in her rickshaw. A place had been secured
in the Kameido gardens—very beautiful now in the cloud
of cherry blossoms. She had preferred a Buddhist to a
Shinto priest; refusing the services of an American or
English missionary. The clerk explained that he was
permitted to tell these things now.... Possibly
Miss Cardinegh would see one or two of her friends at
this time.... Yes, she was in her room.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Come,” she said in a low trailing tone, in response
to Talliaferro’s knock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>Noreen was sitting by the window. The big room had
been put in order. The morning was very still. The
woman was dry-eyed, but white as a flower. She held
out her hand to Talliaferro and tried to smile....
Strangely, he thought of her that moment as one of the
queens of the elder drama—a queen of stirring destiny,
whose personal history was all interpenetrated with
national life, and whom some pretender had caused to be
imprisoned in a tower. This was like Talliaferro.</p>

<p>“We were all ready and so eager to help you, Miss
Cardinegh,” he began. “You know, some of the older of
the British correspondents have dared to feel a proprietary
interest in all that concerns you. Why did you
disappoint us so?”</p>

<p>“I did not want anything done for him—that would
be done on my account,” she said slowly. “It was
mine to do—as his heritage is mine. I only ask you to
think—not that anything can extenuate—but I want you
to think that it was not my father, but his madness.”</p>

<p>“We all understand that—even those who do not
understand <i>all</i> that happened.”</p>

<p>“The tragedy is the same.... Ah, God, how
I wish all the fruits might be mine—not Japan’s, not
Russia’s!”</p>

<p>He started to speak, to uproot from her mind this
crippling conception, but she raised her hand.</p>

<p>“You cannot make me see it differently, Mr. Talliaferro,”
she said tensely. “I have had much time to
think—to see it all! You are very good—all of you.
One thing, I pray you will do for me.”</p>

<p>“You have but to speak it, Miss Cardinegh.”</p>

<p>“When you take the field—all of you, wherever you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
go—watch and listen for any word of Mr. Routledge....
He may be the last to hear that he is vindicated.
Follow any clue to find him. Tell him the truth—tell
him to come to me!”</p>

<p>Peter Pellen’s “Excalibur” accepted the mission,
declaring that he would faithfully impress it upon the
others with the second army, shortly to leave; as Feeney
and Finacune certainly would do with the first. And
so he left her, one of the coldest and dryest men out of
London; and yet, just now, he carried himself under a
stiff curb, lest he forget his war....</p>

<p>“And that’s the end of the man who lowered the
fluids in the British barometer, like a typhoon in the
China Sea,” he observed in solitude. “And the Japanese
buried him in the Kameido, in cherry-blossom time—buried
him for money—the man who opened the veins
of their Empire!”</p>

<p>The work all done, Noreen Cardinegh met the deluge.
The elements had been forming for three days. She had
sensed them vaguely in sudden shivers of dread. Her
soul was bared now to the primal terror, the psychic
terror, of the outcast, against which seasoned valor
quails.... By the window, she sat dry-eyed, in the
midst of her father’s possessions! From the street,
over the hotel-gardens, came to her ears the screaming of
children. Japanese schoolboys were passing, a procession
of them. They were playing soldier—marching very
erect and proudly, with sticks for guns.</p>

<p>“My father did this!”... Upon such a sentence
the whole dreadful structure was built. Thoughts of her
childhood had their significance in the breaking of this
horrid storm of war. Aye, and the little house in Tyrone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
before her coming! It was there that the black shadow,
falling upon his country, crept into the brain of Jerry
Cardinegh. The shadow grew, was identified with her
earliest memories. Into her father’s mortal wound,
inflicted by the passing of the sweetest woman, the
shadow had sunk with all its Tartarean blackness. She
saw it all now—the sinister, mysterious passion which
had rivalled even his love for her. The wars had deepened,
blackened it. The last visit to Ireland had turned
it into hideous, tossing night. And this was the beating
storm—babes with sticks for guns, companies of soldiers
in the <i>Fukiage</i>, the wailing “Banzai Niphon” from Shimbashi
station, where the regiments entrained for the
southern ports of mobilization; and on the lower floor
of the hotel, where still were gathering the war-experts
from all the earth.... The strength ran from her
limbs, and her heart cried out.</p>

<p>Japan, which she had loved, became like a haunted
house to her; yet she could not hope to find Routledge
without some word concerning him, and Tokyo was the
natural base of her search operations. All the correspondents
going out with the different armies were
pledged to communicate with her any word they might
receive regarding him. The correspondents, unsecured
to any of the four armies, and destined to work from
the outside—at Chifu, Newchwang, Chemulpo, Shanhaikwan
or Shanghai—even these had promised her a
cable-flash at the sight of Routledge. Through an agent
in New York she learned that the name “Routledge”
was not attached for work in the Orient to any newspaper
on the Atlantic seaboard; still, by cable she subscribed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
for the chief American newspapers. Tokyo was
her address.</p>

<p>She could not stay longer at the Imperial, which had
become a sort of civilian war headquarters. All was war
in its corridors. In the <i>Minimasacuma-cho</i> of the <i>Shiba</i>
district, she took a small house, establishing herself in
the native style, but she could not escape the agony.
Japan was burning with war-lust from end to end;
whetted of tooth, talon-fingered, blood-mad. Her fighting
force, one of the most formidable masses that ever
formed on the planet’s curve, was landing in Korea and
Liaotung. What meant the battle of the Yalu to her;
the tragedy of the <i>Petropavlovsk</i>, sunk off the tip of the
fortress with Makaroff, the great Verestchagin, and five
hundred officers and men? Not a distant calamity of
foreign powers, but <i>Tyrone</i>—<i>Shubar Khan</i>—<i>Cardinegh</i>—<i>madness</i>—<i>treachery</i>.
What meant the constant tension
of Tokyo, singing in her ears like wires stretched
tight—like the high-pitched, blood-hungry song of
insects in the night? It meant the work of her own
blood, her own accursed heritage.... She was
called to the Imperial often for the mails, but she avoided
the Englishmen there, and admitted none to the little
house in Shiba. Always, when there were white men
about, she fancied a whispering behind her; as, indeed,
there was—the whispers that are incited by the passing
of an exquisite woman.</p>

<p>In the early days following her father’s death,
Noreen was besieged by men who appeared suddenly,
quietly—men unknown in Japan—who demanded with
seeming authority all the documents in her father’s effects
which pertained to the treachery in India. These were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
agents of the great British secret service—men of mystery
to all save those who threatened England’s inner
wall. Noreen gave all that they asked, convinced them
of her sincerity. They impressed upon her the needs of
utter secrecy, and assured her that the name of Routledge
was being purified to the farthest ends of the service. It
was intimated, however, that this would require much
time; as, indeed, it had to fix the crime upon him. These
men worked but little with cables and mails.</p>

<p>So the wire-ends held her to Tokyo through Yalu and
Nanshan to the middle of June. She was returning from
the Imperial at early evening with a bundle of American
newspapers. She knew by the hushed streets that
another battle was in progress; and she felt with the
people the dreadful tension of waiting, as she hurried
swiftly along the wide, dirt-paved Shiba road. Tokyo
was all awake and ominously still. A rickshaw-coolie
darted out from a dark corner with his cart, and accosted
her in a low, persistent way. He wheeled his cart in
front of her, as he would not have dared with a native
or a male foreigner—and all in a silent, alien fashion.
She could not sit still to ride—pushed the rickshaw aside
and sped on in the dusk. She was ill, her throat parched
with waiting, her face white with waiting. The founts of
her life were dry, her heart thralled with famine. Where
was <i>he</i> for this new battle?... She passed knots
of women in the streets. They talked softly as she
passed and laughed at her, held up their boy-babes and
laughed. She knew something of the language, and
caught their whispering—the laughing, child-like women
of Japan, in whom transient foreigners delight. They
breathed world-conquest into the ears of their men-children;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span> 
and were more horrible far in their whispering
and laughing, to Noreen now, than tigresses yammering
in the jungle-dark.</p>

<p>She faltered before the door of her house, afraid.
The servants had not yet lighted the lamps, and within
it was darker than the street.... There, among
the densest shadows, <i>he</i> sat—there, by the covered easel
in a low chair. He was smiling at her, a white and a
weary smile. His long, thin hands were locked above
his head; his lean limbs stretched out in tired fashion,
the puttee leggings worn dull from the saddle fenders;
his chest gaunt, the leather-belt pulled tight.</p>

<p>Noreen sank to her knees before the empty chair, her
face, her arms, in the seat where the mist of a man had
been!... How long she remained there she never
knew; but it was some time before light when she was
aroused by a far, faint roar beating toward her, across
the city. The roar quickened, broke into a great, throbbing,
coherent shout, and swept by like a hurricane,
leaving a city awake and thrown wide open to exultation.
The battle of Telissu had been won. Only defeats are
mourned in Japan, not the slain of a victory. Dawn
broke, and Noreen looked out on an altered Tokyo—loathsome
to her as a gorging reptile.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“You are intensely psychic, Miss Cardinegh,” the
English doctor said. “This ‘vision,’ as you call it, means
nothing in itself—that is, so far as concerns the man you
say you saw—but it signifies that you are on the verge
of a nervous break-down. You must cease all worry
and work, eat plenty of meat, and take long walks. It’s
all nerves, just nerves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“No, it does not mean that your lover is dead,” said
Asia, through the lips of the old Buddhist priest who
had buried her father. “Such things happen this way.
He may have been sleeping, dreaming of you, when the
strength of your heart’s desire rose to the point of calling
his form-body to your house for an instant. It might
have happened before in the daylight, and you did not
know—save that you felt restless possibly, and filled with
strange anguish. Had there been light, you would not
have seen him.”</p>

<p>“But,” she faltered, “I have heard at the moment of
death—such things happen——”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he did not need to die to be called to you.”</p>

<p>Yet she was deathly afraid. It had been the same
after the night of her dream in Cheer Street—the night
that Routledge had slipped from a noose in Madras. If
Noreen had known that!... It is well that she
did not, for she could have borne but little more.</p>

<p>Further weeks ground by. Only in the sense that she
did not die, Noreen lived, moving about her little house,
in daylight and lamp-light, without words, but with many
fears. She tried to paint a little in those wonderful
summer days—days of flashing light, and nights all lit
with divinity—but between her eyes and the canvas,
films of memory forever swung: Routledge-san in Cheer
Street; in the golden stillness of the Seville; the little
Paris studio; in the carriage from Bookstalls to Charing
Cross; in the snowy twilight on the Bund in Shanghai—yes,
and the mist of the man here by the easel!...
Always he was with her, in her heart and in her mind.</p>

<p>Not a word concerning Routledge, from the least or
greatest of the men who had promised to watch for him!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
Often it came to her now that he had either allied himself
with the Russians or avoided the war entirely.
Could it be that he had already followed the prophecy
which Mr. Jasper had repeated for her, and gone to join
Rawder a last time in the Leper Valley?... No
one in Japan had ever heard of the Leper Valley.</p>

<p>There was little mercy in the thought of him being
with the Russians; and yet such a service might have
appealed to a man who desired to remain apart from the
English. If he were in Liaoyang or Mukden, there was
no hope of reaching him, until winter closed the campaign,
at least. Only a few hundred miles away, as the
crow flies, and yet Mukden and Liaoyang could be
approached only from around the world. The valley
between two armies is impassable, indeed—unwired, untracked,
and watched so that a beetle cannot cross unseen....
The general receives a dispatch at dawn containing
the probable movements of the enemy for this day.
One of his spies in the hostile camp which faces him,
less than two miles away, has secured the information
and sent it in—not across the impassable valley, but
around the world.... If Routledge had known
that the curse had been lifted from him, would he not
have rushed back to her? It seemed so, but with the
Russians, he would have been last to learn what had
befallen.</p>

<p>Just once—and it marked the blackest hour of that
black summer in Japan—the thought flooded upon her
that Routledge knew, but purposely remained apart; that
he was big enough to make the great sacrifice for her,
but not to return to the woman whose heritage, in turn,
was the Hate of London. That hour became a life-long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
memory, even though the thought was whipped and
shamed and beaten away.</p>

<p>It was late in July when certain sentences in an
American newspaper rose with a thrilling welcome to her
eyes. There was an intimate familiarity, even in the
heading, which he might not have written, but which
reflected the movement and color of his work. It was in
the <i>World-News</i> of New York, and signed “A. V.
Weed.”... A rather long feature cable dated at
Chifu shortly after the battle of Nanshan. A number
of Russian prisoners had been taken by the Japanese,
and with them was a certain Major Volbars, said to be
the premier swordsman of the Russian Empire. The
Japanese heard of his fame; and, as it appears, became at
once eager to learn if Russian civilization produced
sword-arms equal to those of her own Samurai. The
prisoner was asked to meet one Watanabe, a young infantry
captain, and of that meeting the <i>World-News</i> published
the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... Here was armistice, the nucleus of which was combat.
There was a smile upon the face of Watanabe, a snarling smile,
for his lips were drawn back, showing irregular teeth, glistening
white. His low brow was wrinkled and his close-cropped,
bristling hair looked dead-black in the vivid noon. The hilt of
his slim blade was polished like lacquer from the nimble hands
of his Samurai fathers. This was Watanabe of Satsuma, whose
wrist was a dynamo and whose thrusts were sparks. The devil
looked out from his fighting-face.</p>

<p>Volbars compelled admiration—a conscienceless man, from
his eyes, but courageous. He was small, heavy-shouldered, and
quick of movement, with nervous eyes and hands. His left
cheek was slashed with many scars, and his head inclined slightly
to the right, through a certain muscular contraction of the neck
or shoulder. This master of the archaic art had the love of his
soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“In the name of God, let him take the attack, Major!”
Volbars’ second whispered. “His style may disconcert you.”</p>

<p>The Russian waved the man away, and faced the Japanese
swordsman. His head seemed to lie upon his right shoulder,
and his cruel, sun-darkened face shone with joy. His thick,
gleaming white arm was bare. His blade, which had opened the
veins of a half-hundred Europeans, screamed like a witch as the
master-hand tried it in thin air.</p>

<p>The weapons touched. The styles of the antagonists were
different, but genius met genius on its own high ground. Each
blade was a quiver of arrows, each instant of survival due to
devilish cunning or the grace of God. In spite of his warning,
Volbars took the attack and forced it tigerishly. Some demon
purpose was in his brain, for he shot his volleys high. A marvelous
minute passed, and a fountain of crimson welled from
Watanabe, where his neck and shoulder met. The heavy
breathing of the Russian was heard now back among his fellow
prisoners. The Japanese, sheeted with blood from his wound,
defended himself silently. He was younger, lighter, superbly
conditioned.</p>

<p>The face of Volbars changed hideously. Sweat ran into
his eyes, where the desperation of fatigue was plain. His lips
were stiff white cords. Patches of grayish white shone in his
cheeks and temples.... For a second his shoulders lifted;
then an exultant gasp was heard from his dry throat.</p>

<p>That which had been the left eye in the face of Watanabe
burst like a bubble and ran down. Yet not for the fraction of
a second did the Japanese lose his guard. Though a window
of his throne-room was broken, the kingdom of his courage still
endured. The Russian second heard his man gasp, “I’m spent.
I can’t kill him!”</p>

<p>The grin upon the awful face of the One-eyed became more
tense. He seized the aggressive, and the Japanese lines greeted
the change with a high-strung, ripping shout. Watanabe bored
in, stabbing like a viper, his head twisted to spare his dark side.
Volbars’ limbs were stricken of power. He saw the end, as he
was backed toward the prisoners. A tuft of grass unsteadied
him for a second—and the Japanese lightning struck.</p>

<p>The sword of the Russian quivered to the earth and the
master fell upon it, his face against the ground, his naked
sword-arm shaking, the hand groping blindly for the faithless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
hilt. Watanabe bowed to the prisoners, and walked unassisted
back to his own roaring lines. His seconds followed closely,
one of them wiping the sword of the Samurai with a wisp of
grass.... It appears that Volbars had the audacity to
attempt to blind his opponent before killing him. It was like
the battle of the Yalu. Volbars, as did General Zassulitch,
looked too lightly on the foe....</p>
</div>

<p>“A. V. Weed”—what blessings fell upon the name
that moment!... He was not with the Russians!
Not in the Leper Valley! A cable to the <i>World-News</i>
that night brought a reply the next day, to the effect
that “A. V. Weed” had never been in touch with the
office; that he was the freest of free lances, and brought
his messages from time to time to one of the free cables
outside the war-zone.... The free cable nearest to
Liaoyang—already granted to be the next scene of conflict—was
at Shanhaikwan, at the end of the Great Wall.
Noreen arranged for mail and dispatches to follow her,
and went down the Tokaido, overtaking at Nagasaki a
ship which had sailed from Yokohama three days before
she left.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TWENTIETH CHAPTER<br>

<small>ROUTLEDGE IS SEEN BY NOREEN CARDINEGH, BUT
AT AN EXCITING MOMENT IN WHICH SHE
DARE NOT CALL HIS NAME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Noreen</span> breathed sweeter with the shores of Japan
behind. The Pacific liner, <i>Manchu</i>, was crossing the
Yellow Sea for Shanghai. An evening in early August,
and the tropic breeze came over the moon-flecked water,
from the spicy archipelagoes below. It was late, and she
was sitting alone, forward on the promenade-deck. The
thought thralled, possessed her completely, that she was
drawing nearer, nearer her soul’s mate. Might it not
be given to her to keep the covenant—to find him, though
all others had failed?... There was a high light
over Asia for her inner eye, this memorable night of her
romance. The crush of Japan was gone, and in the
great hour of emancipation her love for Routledge,
hardiest of perennials, burst into a delicate glory of
blossoming—countless blooms of devotion, pure white;
and in all honor she could not deny—rare fragrant
flowerings of passional crimson....</p>

<p>At Shanghai she sought the office of the <i>North China
News</i>, to learn what the war had done during her three
days at sea. The Japanese armies were panting—inside
the passes which had recently protected Liaoyang. Any
day might begin the battle with which Japan intended
forever to end Russia’s hold in Liaotung peninsula. The
<i>News</i> stated blithely that there was no doubt of the war<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
being over by September.... There was another
story in the files of early August, and in the silent office
the woman bent long over the sheet, huge as a luncheon-cover.
This was an Indian exchange with a Simla mark.
An English correspondent, wandering somewhere in the
Hills, had run across a white man travelling with an old
Hindu lama. A weird mad pair, the story said, half-starving,
but they asked no alms. Whither they were
going, they would not say, nor from whence they had
come. The natives seemed to understand the wanderers,
and possibly filled the lama’s bowl. The feet of the
white man were bare and travel-bruised, his clothing a
motley of Hindu and Chinese garments. The article
intimated that he was a “gone-wrong missionary,” but its
whole purport and excuse was to point out the menace
to British India from unattached white men, mad or
apparently mad, moving where they willed, in and out
of restless States, especially at such a time as now, when
the activity of foreign agents, etc., etc....</p>

<p>The article was rock-tight and bitter with the Dead
Sea bitterness. The pressure of the whole senile East
was in it. The woman quivered from a pain the prints
had given her, and moved out of the darkened office
into the strange road, thick and yellow with heat....
Could this be Rawder and his Hindu master?...
It occurred to her suddenly that the men of the
newspaper might be able to tell her of the Leper Valley.
She turned back to the office, was admitted to the
editor.... No, he had not heard of the Leper
Valley. There were leper colonies scattered variously
throughout the interior. It might be one of them....
She thanked him and went away, leaving a problem to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
mystify many sleepy, sultry days.... That night,
Noreen engaged passage in a coasting steamer for
Tongu, and on the morning of the third day thereafter
boarded the Peking-Shanhaikwan train on the Chinese
Eastern.</p>

<p>Alone in a first-class compartment, she watched the
snaky furrows of maize throughout seven eternities of
daylight, until her eyes stung and her brain revolted at
the desolate, fenceless levels of sun-deadened brown.
Out of a pent and restless doze, at last she found that
a twilight film had cooled the distance; she beheld the
sea on her right hand, and before her the Great Wall—that
gray welt on the Eastern world, conceived centuries
before the Christ, rising into the dim mountains and
jutting down into the sea. In an inexplicable moment of
mental abstraction, as the train drew up to Shanhaikwan,
the soul of the weary woman whispered to her that she
had seen it all before.</p>

<p>At the Rest House, Noreen ventured to inquire of
a certain agent of a big British trading company if he
knew any of the English or American war-correspondents
who had come recently to Shanhaikwan to file their
work on the uncensored cable. This man was an unlovely
Englishman poisoned by China and drink....
Oh, yes, some of the men had come in from the field
or from Wangcheng with big stories, but had trouble
getting back to their lines, it was said.</p>

<p>“Have you heard—or do you know—if Mr. Routledge
has been here?”</p>

<p>His face filled with an added inflammation, and he
mumbled something which had to do with Routledge
and the treachery in India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>“Do you mean to say,” she demanded hopelessly,
“that you—that Shanhaikwan has not heard that Mr.
Routledge had nothing to do with the treachery in India—that
another, Cardinegh of the <i>Witness</i>, confessed the
crime on his death-bed?”</p>

<p>The Englishman had not heard. He bent toward her
with a quick, aroused look and wanted to know all, but
she fled to her room.... It was not strange if
Routledge failed to hear of his vindication, when this
British agent had not.... By the open window
she sat for hours staring at the Great Wall in the moonlight.
She saw it climb through the white sheen which
lay upon the mountains, and saw it dip into the twinkling
sea, like a monster that has crawled down to drink.
There were intervals when Shanhaikwan was still as
the depths of the ocean. The whole landscape frightened
her with its intimate reality. The thought came again
that this had once been <i>her</i> country, that she had seen the
Mongol builders murdered by the lash and the toil.</p>

<p>The purest substance of tragedy evolved in her brain.
There had been something abhorrent in contact with the
Englishman below. She had seen a hate for Routledge
like that before—at the Army and Navy reception!
And then, the sinister narrative of the white man in
India, as it had been set down by the English correspondent!...
Could this be “their bravest man”?
Was he, too, attracting hatred and suspicion in India,
as a result of the excitement into which her father’s
work had thrown the English? Could not poor Rawder,
barefoot, travel-bruised, and wearing a motley of native
garments, be free from this world-havoc which was her
heritage?... That instant in the supremacy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
pain she could not feel in her heart that Routledge
wanted her—or that he was in the world!... Could
he be dead, or in the Leper Valley? Had his mind gone
back to dust—burned out by these terrible currents of
hatred?...</p>

<p>The pictured thought drew forth a stifled scream.
The lamp in her room was turned low, and the still,
windless night was a pitiless oppression. Crossing the
room to open the door, in agony for air, she passed the
mirror and saw a dim reflection—white arms, white
throat, white face. She turned the knob.</p>

<p>The clink of glasses on a tin-tray reached her from
below, with the soft tread of a native servant; then from
farther, the clink of billiard-balls and a man’s voice, low
but insinuating, its very repression an added vileness:</p>

<p>“Dam’ me, but she was a stunning woman, a ripping
woman—and out after——”</p>

<p>She crashed the door shut and bolted it against the
pestilence.... Had the powers of evil this night
consummated a heinous mockery to test her soul, because
her soul was strong?... In terror and agony, she
knelt by the open window. The Wall was still there,
sleeping in the moonlight—the biggest man-made thing
in the world, and the quietest. It steadied her, and the
stuff of martyrs came back.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The man in charge of the cable-office in Shanhaikwan
told her the next morning that a correspondent who
signed himself “A. V. Weed” had brought in a long
message for New York, just after the Yalu battle, but
had not tarried even a night in town. “A tall, haggard
stranger with a low voice,” the man described him....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
There was little more to be learned, but this
was life to her, and the first tangible word, that he lived,
since her father’s death. Noreen spent the day walking
alone on the beaches and through the foreign concession.</p>

<p>From the top of the Wall in the afternoon, she stared
down at the little walled city which grew out of the
great masonry. There she could see a bit of living
China—all its drones and workers and sections and galleries,
as in a glass bee-hive. Big thoughts took the
breath from her. Europe seemed young and tawdry
beside this. She picked up one of the loose stones—touched
the hem of the Wall’s garment, as it were—and
again she had but to close her eyes and look back
centuries into the youth of time, when the Wall was
building, to see the Mongols swarming like ants over
the raw, half-done thing.... There was a little
French garrison in the town; and the Sikh infantry, at
target-practice on the beach, brought India back. The
day was not without fascination to her relieved mind.</p>

<p>The evening train from Peking brought a white man
who added to the stability of Shanhaikwan—Talliaferro
of the <i>Commonwealth</i>. The dry little man was greatly
disturbed in heart. He had deliberately given up his
place with Oku’s second army, choosing to miss the smoky
back-thresh of future actions in the field, in order to
get what he could out on the free cable. Peter Pellen’s
“Excalibur,” credited with acumen, flying and submarine,
had broken under the Japanese pressure.</p>

<p>“Have you seen or heard of Mr. Routledge?” she
whispered at dinner.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied. “In the field we never got a
whisper from him. The Pan-Anglo man in Shanghai<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
told me, however, that he thought Routledge was playing
the Chinese end—that is, living just outside the war-zone
and making sallies in, from time to time, when things
are piping hot. The reason he thought Routledge was
working this game was the fact that New York has
sprung three or four great stories which London has
missed entirely. It’s all a guess, Miss Cardinegh, but
somebody is doing it, and it’s his kind of service—the
perilous, hard-riding kind. Nobody but a man on the
<i>Inside</i> of Asia would attempt it. There was an American,
named Butzel, shot by the Chinese on the Liao River
ten days ago. He was not an accredited correspondent,
as I understand it, but was using the war for a living.
Butzel’s death was wired in from the interior somewhere,
and they had it back from New York in Shanghai
when I was there. Did you hear?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“It appears that Butzel planned to get into Liaoyang
for the battle,” Talliaferro went on, “whether the Japanese
liked it or not. About the place where the Taitse
flows into the Liao, the river-pirates murdered him——”</p>

<p>Talliaferro stopped, startled by the look in the face
of the woman. Her eyes were wide, almost electric with
suffering, her face colorless. The lamp-light heightened
the effects; also her dress, which was of black entire.
Talliaferro noted such things. He always remembered
her hand that moment, as it was raised to check him,
white, fragile, emotional.</p>

<p>“What is it, Miss Cardinegh?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p>“I was thinking,” she replied steadily, “that Mr.
Routledge is there in all likelihood—‘playing the Chinese
end,’ as you call it. I was thinking that he might not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
have heard that he is vindicated—that he might be murdered
before he learned that my father had confessed.”</p>

<p>She hurried away before the dinner was half through,
and Talliaferro was left to dislike himself, for a short
period, for bringing up the Butzel murder....
Noreen sat again by the window in her room. The
story had frightened her, so that she felt the need of
being alone to think. The dreadfulness of the night
before did not return, however.... The moon
rose high to find the Wall again—every part of it, winding
in the mountains.... Was it not possible that
Talliaferro was over-conscious of the dangers of the
Chinese end? Routledge had been up there, possibly
since the Yalu battle, and he had proved a master in
these single-handed services of his.... She had
heard of Talliaferro’s capacity to command the highest
price, heard of him as an editorial dictator and of his
fine grasp on international affairs, but her father had
once remarked that the Excalibur “did not relish dangling
his body in the dirty area between two firing lines.”...
There was hope in her heart, and she slept.</p>

<p>“Please don’t apologize, Mr. Talliaferro,” she said
the next morning, when he met her sorrowfully. “It is
I who should apologize. For a moment you made me
see vividly the dangers up yonder, but I put it all away
and had a real rest. Tell me about the field and Oku.”</p>

<p>Talliaferro was inclined to talk very little, as a rule,
but he had brooded deeply upon his failure in this service,
and it was rather a relief to speak—with Noreen Cardinegh
to listen.</p>

<p>“At least, we have added to the gaiety of nations
with our silence in the field,” he said. “It has been the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
silence of the Great Wall yonder. We knew nothing
even of the main strategy, which was familiar to all outside
who cared to follow the war. Japanese officers were
assigned to overhear what we said to one another. They
even opened our personal mail. The field-telegraph was
hot day and night with the war-business, so that our
messages were hung up for days, even with the life cut
out of them. And then when Oku drove into action we
were always back with the reserves—not that I think a
correspondent can do a battle classic for his cable-editor,
simply because he mingles first hand with shrapnel; but
we had only the sun and stars to go by as to which was
north and south. Think of it, and the man who writes
a war-classic must have a conception of the whole land
and sea array, and an inner force of his own, to make
his sentences shine——”</p>

<p>She smiled a little and straightened her shoulders to
breathe deeply the good sea air. They were walking
out toward the Wall.</p>

<p>“But suppose he has the big conception, as you say,
and then goes into the heart of the thing”—her voice
became tense—“where the poor brave brutes are coming
together to die?”</p>

<p>“He’ll unquestionably do it better,” said Talliaferro,
regarding her blowing hair with satisfaction to the artistic
sense he cultivated. “Physical heroism is cheap—the
cheapest utility of the nations—but it is not without
inspiration to watch.... We had neither—neither
facts nor blood with Oku.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Long and weary were those August days in Shanhaikwan.
Noreen lived for the end of the battle, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
with a prayer that it would end the war and bring in—all
the correspondents. Over and over she mapped the
war-country in her mind, with a lone horseman shutting
out her view of armies. There were moments at night in
which she felt that Routledge-san was not far away—even
Liaoyang was less than three hundred miles away....
Those last days of the month—only a woman
can bear such terrors of tension. Each night-train now
brought vagrant sentences from the field, bearing upon
the unparalleled sacrifices of men by the Japanese.
Throughout August thirty-first, Shanhaikwan waited
expectantly for a decision from the battle, but when the
night-train was in the Russians were still holding. Late
in the afternoon of September first, Talliaferro sought
Miss Cardinegh bringing an exciting rumor that the
Japanese had won the battle and the city.</p>

<p>“There’s another thing,” he added. “The English
agent of the trading company here—the man of whom
you don’t approve—has heard from Bingley. He will
be in from Wangcheng to-night, and something big is
up. Bingley has called for a horse to meet him at the
train—a fast horse. I’ll wager there’s an American correspondent
on the train, Miss Cardinegh, and that the
‘Horse-killer’ plans to beat him to the cable-office in
the half-mile from the station. He wouldn’t wire for a
horse if he were alone. Another matter. Borden, the
American Combined Press man here, looks to have something
big under cover. Altogether, I think there’ll be
great stuff on the cable to-night. The chief trouble is,
there won’t be any core—to Bingley’s apple.... I’ll
call for you in a half-hour—if I may—and we’ll walk
down to the train together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“Thank you. Of course,” she answered....
That half-hour pulled a big tribute of nervous energy.
Noreen did not know what to think, but she fought back
hope with all the strength which months of self-war had
given....</p>

<p>The train appeared at last through the gap in the
Great Wall—cleared torturingly slow in the twilight.
Talliaferro directed her eyes to two saddle-horses on the
platform. Borden, the American, was in touch with a
China-boy who held a black stallion of notorious prowess....
She hardly noted. The train held her eyes. Her
throat was dry—her heart stormed with emotion....
She did not scream. Routledge hung far out from the
platform—searching to locate his mount. She covered
her face in her parasol.... This was the end of a
race from the field with Bingley.... She choked
back her heart’s cry, lest it complicate.</p>

<p>Routledge sped past her—leaped with a laugh into
the saddle of the black stallion. His eye swept the
crowd—but the yellow silk of the parasol shielded her
face. He spurred off toward the cable-office—with
Bingley thundering behind on a gray mount....
Not till then did she dare to scream:</p>

<p>“Win! Ride to win, Routledge-san!”</p>

<p>Out of the shouting crowd, she ran after the horsemen—past
the Rest House, through the mud-huts of the
native quarter.... On she sped, the night filled
with glory for her eyes.... Suddenly there was
a shot—then four more—from ahead. Fear bound her
limbs, and she struggled on—as in the horrid weights of
an evil dream.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TWENTY-FIRST CHAPTER<br>

<small>ROUTLEDGE, BROODING UPON THE MIGHTY SPECTACLE
OF A JAPANESE BIVOUAC, TRACES A
WORLD-WAR TO THE LEAK IN
ONE MAN’S BRAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Parting</span> from Noreen Cardinegh on the Bund at
Shanghai, Routledge walked back through the darkness
to the German Inn far out on the Hankow road. He
was not conscious of the streets, nor of time passed. Not
a word he had spoken to the woman could he remember,
but all that she had said recurred again and again. He
was torn within. The wound was too deep for heavy
pain at first—that would come later with the drawing-together—but
he was dazed, weakened. He turned into
the door of the hostelry and recalled that he had nothing
to do there. He had engaged passage on the <i>Sungkiang</i>
for Chifu that afternoon. His baggage was aboard,
and the ship lying on the water-front which he had left.
He turned back, without any particular emotion at his
absentmindedness, but he charged himself with an evil
recklessness for tarrying on the Bund in the afternoon....
Finacune had seen him, and Noreen....</p>

<p>Jerry Cardinegh was still alive—lost to wars, lost to
friends, but still alive. He was close to death, his brain
probably already dead to big things, and he had not told!
Noreen would never know. Routledge tried to be glad.
All his praying, hiding, and suffering had been to save
her from knowing. His lips formed a meaningless
declarative sentence to the effect that he was glad;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
meaningless, because there was no sanction in his heart.
He was ill and very weary. He wished it were time for
the prophesied wound, and for Noreen to come to him.
He was not powerful enough that moment, walking back
to the Bund, to face the future, and hold the thought that
he was to remain an outcast....</p>

<p>“She will come to me when Jerry is dead,” he repeated,
and for the time he could not fight it....
He went aboard, forgetting dinner, and dropped upon his
berth. The <i>Sungkiang</i> put off, out into the river, and
long afterward lifted to the big swell in the offing. These
were but faint touches of consciousness. His mind held
greater matters—the strength of her hand, the breath,
the fragrance, the vehemence, the glory of the woman
in the wintry dusk, as she rushed back to her work—the
tearing tragedy of parting; again the pitiless mountains
of separation....</p>

<p>Loose articles were banging about the floor; the
pendent oil-lamp creaked with the pitching of the ship.
It was after midnight. Routledge caught up the great
frieze coat and went out on the main-deck. It was a
cold ruffian of a night, but it restored his strength.</p>

<p>She would keep her promise and come to him, when
her father was dead. He faced the thought now that she
would never know the truth; that Jerry Cardinegh would
have spoken long since, if he could.... In some
deep dark place of the earth, she would find him; and
some British eye, ever keen, would see them together—the
lady and the outcast.... He would send her away—put
on a martyrdom of frost and steel—and send her
away.... If he lied, saying that he wanted no
woman—she would go back.... But Noreen was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
to find him wounded, fallen. Might he not, in delirium,
utter the truth that her father failed to confess? No,
the human will could prevent that! He would go down
close to the very Gates with his lips locked.</p>

<p>“... I shall take care of your life for you—even
in the Leper Valley!” Routledge thought he must
be mad to imagine those words. Her face—as the words
came to him—had been blotted out in the snow and the
dark; yet it was her voice, and the words rang through
his soul. She could not have seen Rawder nor the
Hindu. They were lost in Northern India. He knew
nothing of Jasper having passed the hut in Rydamphur
that night, nor of his meeting with Noreen on ship-board.
The Leper Valley, hidden in the great mountains
of Southern China, was scarcely a name to the
world. Could Noreen have heard the name, and used
it merely as a symbol of speech for the uttermost parts
of the earth? This was the only adjustment of the
mystery upon a material basis.</p>

<p>He fought it all out that night in the icy gale on the
main-deck of the <i>Sungkiang</i>, and entered upon the loneliest,
harshest campaign and the bleakest season of his
life.... Often it came to him with a great, almost
an overpowering surge—the passion to look into the
eyes of Noreen Cardinegh again and to stand among
men, but he fought it with the grim, immutable fact that
he had taken her father’s crime and must keep it, stand
by it, with his dearest efforts until the end. If fate
destined some time to lift the burden—that was resistless....
Except in bringing in his stories to the
cables, he passed the spring and summer in the deepest
seclusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>This he knew: if he were seen by any of his old
friends among the English, the word would be carried to
Jerry Cardinegh, who, if still alive, might be stirred to
confession. To save Noreen from this was the first
point of his sacrifice. If her father were dead, unconfessed,
and word reached her that the outcast had been
seen in a certain part of Manchuria, she would come to
share his hell-haunted-life—a thought which his whole
manhood shunned. Moreover, if he were seen by the
British, the sinister powerful fingers of the secret service
would stretch toward him; in which case, if nothing
worse happened, he would be driven from the terrain
of war. Work was his only boon—furious, unabating,
world-rousing work. God so loved the world that he
gave unto poor forlorn man his work.... No
more loitering on Bunds or Foreign Concessions for
Cosmo Routledge.</p>

<p>From various Chinese bases, he made flying incursions
into the war-belt for the <i>World-News</i>—a lonely,
perilous, hard-shipping, and hard-riding service, but
astonishingly successful. It was his flash from Chifu
which told New York that the war was on before the
declaration. This was on the night of February eighth.
A strong but not a roaring west wind brought Togo’s
firing across the gulf. He chanced a message and verified
it before dawn by an incoming German ship, which
had steamed past the fortress when the Russian fleet was
attacked.</p>

<p>Again, he was with the Russians at Wangcheng before
the port was closed, and got the story of the Yalu fight.
This through John Milner, the American consul at
Wangcheng, in whom he made a staunch and valued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
friend, regretting that it was necessary to do so under
the name of “A. V. Weed.” Milner was an old <i>World-News</i>
editor, a man of stirring energy, and strong in
the graces of the Russians at his post. He was ardent
to serve all American interests, and the <i>World-News</i> in
particular. He presented Routledge to General Borodoffsky,
who told the story of the battle; and there was
a fine touch in the fact that the general wept as he
related the Russian defeat. The story proved more complete
and accurate than any which the correspondents
with Kuroki managed to get through the Japanese censor.
Kuroki’s great losses by drowning were for the first time
brought out. Borodoffsky declared with tears that the
future of the war must not be judged by this battle, as
the Russian defeat was due entirely to an error of judgment.
Routledge was leaving Wangcheng with the story
when two British correspondents arrived. This prevented
his return. The Borodoffsky story was filed in
Shanhaikwan.</p>

<p>In a sea-going junk, the third week of May, Routledge
crossed the Liaotung Gulf, hoping to get into
Port Arthur, which was not yet invested. Instead, he
stumbled onto the Nanshan story. From the northern
promontory of Kinchow he caught a big and valuable
conception of this literatesque engagement of the land
and sea forces, and returned with it to Chifu for filing.</p>

<p>Back to lower Liaotung again, in early June. In spite
of every precaution, one of Togo’s gunboats ran him
down in Society Bay, and he was sent ashore under a
guard. Great luck served him, inasmuch as there were
no English with the Japanese at this place, Pulatien,
where he was held for ten days, while the officers debated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
upon his credentials. It was here that Routledge encountered
the prettiest feature-story of the war—the duel of
Watanabe and Major Volbars, a prisoner from Nanshan.
The Japanese escorted him to his junk at last, and he
put off with orders from one of Togo’s ensigns to return
no more to Kwantung waters. The battle of Telissu
was fought on this day at sea, and he missed it entirely.
With English now in Wangcheng and Chifu, Routledge
ordered his Chinese to sail north, and to put him ashore
at Yuenchen, a little port twenty miles to the west of
the Liao’s mouth.</p>

<p>It was only by a squeak that the order was carried
out. That was a night of furies on the yellow gulf.
Bent in the hold, thigh-deep in tossing water, Routledge
recalled the hovel in Rydamphur with a sorry smile. It
did not seem at that moment that the storm would ever
permit him to be maimed on land—or a woman to come
to him. The old craft was beaten about under bare
poles in a roaring black that seemed to drop from chaos.
The Chinese fought for life, but the gray of death-fear
was upon them. Bruised, almost strangled, Routledge
crouched in the musty hold, until his mind fell at last
into a strange abstraction, from which he aroused after
an unknown time. His physical weariness was extreme,
but it did not seem possible that he could have slept,
standing in black, foaming water, and with a demoniacal
gale screeching outside. Yet certainly something had
gone from him and had taken his consciousness, or the
better part of it.... It was this night that Noreen
Cardinegh had entered at dusk her little house in Minimasacuma-cho
and met by the easel the visible thought-form
of her lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>Day broke with the wind lulled, and the old craft
riding monster seas, her poles still to the sky. The daylight
sail brought him to Yuenchen; from whence he
made his way northward by land to Pingyang. This
town was but an hour’s saddle to the east of the railroad
and telegraph at Koupangtze—twenty miles west of the
junction of the Taitse and the Liao river, and fifty miles
west of Liaoyang. Here he established headquarters
completely out of the white man’s world, rested and
wrote mail stories for several weeks. Toward the end
of July, he set out on a ten days’ saddle trip toward
Liaoyang, with the idea of becoming familiar with the
topography of the country, in preparation for the battle,
already in sight. It was on this trip that he was hailed
one afternoon by an American, named Butzel. This
young man was sitting on the aft-gunnel of a river-junk,
rolling a cigarette, when Routledge turned his horse upon
the Taitse river-road, four or five miles to the east of the
Liao. Routledge would have avoided the meeting had
he been given a chance, but Butzel gaily ordered his
Chinese to put ashore. The voice was that of a man
from the Middle States—and Routledge filled with yearning
to take a white hand. His only friend since he had
left Rawder in India was Consul Milner at Wangcheng.</p>

<p>Butzel had journeyed thus deep into the elder world—as
natural an explorer as ever left behind his nerves and
his saving portion of fear. He hadn’t any particular
credentials, he said, and hadn’t played the newspaper
game very strongly up to now. The Japanese had refused
to permit him to go out with any of the armies;
and he had tried to get into Port Arthur with a junk,
but Togo had driven him off. He had very little money,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
and was tackling China to get to the Russian lines. It
was his idea for the Russians to capture him, and, incidentally,
to show him how they could defend Liaoyang.
In a word, he was eluding Japan, bluffing his way through
the interior of China, and about to enforce certain hospitality
from the Russians. A great soul—in this little
man, Butzel.</p>

<p>Routledge delighted in him, but feared for his life.
He himself was playing a similar lone-hand, but he
carried Red-beard insignia, purchased at a big price;
and when he had ventured into a river or sea-junk, he
had taken pains to arrange that his receipt for a certain
extortion was hung high on the foremast. Thus was
he ever approved by the fascinating brotherhood of junk
pirates. These were details entirely above the Butzel
purse and inclination. The two men parted in fine spirit
after an hour, the adventurer urging his Chinese up the
Taitse toward the Russian lines. He was not so poor
as he had been, and he yelled back joyously to Routledge
that there wasn’t enough trails in this little piker of a
planet to keep them from meeting again.</p>

<p>His words proved true. Poor Butzel rode back in
state that afternoon, his head fallen against the tiller
and a bullet hole in his breast. Even his clothing had
been taken. The junk was empty except for the body.
With a heavy heart, Routledge attended to the burial
and marked the spot. That night he rode to Koupangtze,
and, by paying the charges, succeeded in arranging for a
brief message to be cabled to the <i>World-News</i>; also a
telegram to the American consul at Shanghai.</p>

<p>So much is merely a suggestion of the work that
told for his paper that summer. For weeks at a time he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
was in the saddle, or junking it by sea and river. Except
when driven to the telegraph, he avoided every port town
and every main-travelled road. He was lean, light but
prodigiously strong. A trencherman of ordinary valor
would have dragged out a hateful existence of semi-starvation
upon the rations that sufficed for Routledge;
and none but a man in whom a giant’s strength was concentrated
could have followed his travels. The old Manchurian
trails burned under his ponies; and, queerly
enough, he never ruined a mount. He had left Shanghai
on the first of February, ill from confinement, the crowds,
and his long sojourn in the great heat of India. The
hard physical life at sea in the Liao gulf and afield in
Manchuria, and, possibly more than anything, his life
apart from the English, restored him to a health of the
finest and toughest texture.</p>

<p>China challenged him. He never could feel the tenderness
of regard for the Yellow Empire that India inspired,
but it held an almost equal fascination. China
dwelt in a duller, more alien light to his eyes; the people
were more complicated, less placable and lovable, than
Hindus, but the same mysterious stillness, the same
dust of ages, he found in both interiors; and in both
peoples the same imperturbable patience and unfathomable
capacity to suffer and be silent. Routledge moved
in towns almost as unknown to the world as the Martian
surfaces; learned enough of the confusion of tongues to
procure necessities; supplied himself with documents,
bearing the seals of certain dark fraternities, which
appeared to pass him from place to place without harm:
and, with a luck that balanced the handicap of an outcast,
and an energy, mental and physical, utterly impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
to a man with peace in his heart, he pushed through, up
to Liaoyang, an almost incredible season’s work.</p>

<p>More and more the thought was borne upon him during
July and August that the coming big battle would
bring to him a change of fortune—if only a change from
one desolation to another. He felt that his war-service
was nearing its end. He did not believe that Liaoyang
was to end the war, but he thought it would close the
campaign for the year; and he planned to conclude his
own campaign with a vivid intimate portrait of the
battle. Meanwhile he hung afar from the Russian and
Japanese lines, and little Pingyang had a fire lit for
him and a table spread when he rode in from his
reconnoissance.</p>

<p>Late in August, when the artillery began, Routledge
crossed to the south bank of the Taitse with a pair of
good horses, and left them about two miles to the west of
the city with a Pingyang servant who had proven trustworthy.
On the dawn of the thirtieth he made a wide
detour behind Oku, nearly to Nodzu’s lines, and watched
the battle from Sha peak—one of the highest points of the
range. He had studied Liaoyang long through the
intricate Chinese maps; and as the heights had cleared
the fighting-field for Bingley, so now did Routledge
grasp the topography from his eyrie during that first day
of the real battle. Similarly also, he hit upon Kuroki’s
flank movement as the likeliest strategy of the Japanese
aggression, and he came to regard it as a fact before
starting for the free cable at Wangcheng the following
night.</p>

<p>This day netted nothing in so far as the real battle
color was considered. That night he closed up on Oku’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
rear, crossing a big valley and climbing a lesser range.
Daylight found him in a densely thicketed slope overlooking
the city and the Japanese command. In that
hot red dawn, he beheld the bivouac of the Islanders—a
crowded valley stretching away miles to the east in the
fast lifting gloom; leagues of stirring men, the faint
smell of wood-smoke and trampled turf, the gray, silent
city over the reddened hills, the slaty coil of the river
behind.</p>

<p>The mighty spectacle gripped the heart of the
watcher; and there came to him, with an awful but thrilling
intensity, the whole story of the years which had
prepared this amphitheatre for blood on this sweet last
summer day.... Oppression in Tyrone; treachery
in India; the Anglo-Japanese alliance; the Russo-Japanese
war—a logical line of cause and effect running true
as destiny, straight as a sunbeam through all these huge
and scattered events—holding all Asia in the palm of
history! Farther back, to the Kabul massacre, was to
be traced the red history of this day—the mad British
colonel; Shubar Khan!... And what did the
future hold? If Russia called the French and Germans to
her aid, England, by treaty, was called to the aid of
Japan. America might be drawn by the needs of England,
or for the protection of her softening cluster of
Philippine grapes. Famine in a Tyrone town; a leak
in one Tyrone patriot’s brain—and a world-war!...</p>

<p>The click of a rifle jerked Routledge out of his
musings. A Japanese lieutenant and a non-commissioned
officer were standing twenty paces away. The enlisted
man had him covered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TWENTY-SECOND CHAPTER<br>

<small>ROUTLEDGE STRIKES A CONTRAST BETWEEN THE
JAPANESE EMPEROR AND THE JAPANESE
FIGHTING-MAN, WHILE OKU CHARGES
INTO A BLIZZARD OF STEEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Queerly</span> enough, Routledge’s first thought was that
the moment of the wound had come, but this was out of
the question. These men would not fire at him. They
would send him to the rear under a guard; or, worse,
escort him to the command where the other correspondents
were held. The Englishmen would then suggest
to the Japanese that their captive had once proved a
traitor to England, and that it would be well to look
deep into his present business, lest he repeat....
He would miss the battle, be detained for a Russian spy—and
Noreen would hear.</p>

<p>Routledge was ordered to approach, and obeyed,
swallowing Failure. The lieutenant spoke English, but
disdained to look at proffered credentials. The sergeant
gripped Routledge’s arm, and his superior led the way
down the slope through the lines of troops. Many of the
little soldiers of Oku were eating rice and drinking tea
from bowls; some were bathing their bodies, others
cleansing their teeth with great zeal, using soaps and
pointed sticks. These meant to be gathered unto their
fathers that day with clean mouths. Down and forward,
the American was led, no word being spoken until they
were in the midst of Oku’s front. Here was the field<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
headquarters of some high officer of the left wing. Routledge
breathed a hope that action would be joined before
he was ordered back. The unknown commander stood
in the centre of a thick protecting cordon of men. Evidently
he was too rushed at present to attend the case
of the detained civilian. Aides and orderlies spurred
out with dispatches, and others riding in took their
places.</p>

<p>Three or four minutes had passed when certain commands
went ripping down the unformed lines and action
was indeed joined. The lieutenant was brushed away in
the torrent of infantry which just now swept over them,
but the sergeant held grimly to his prisoner’s arm. Oku
had ordered the first charge of the day. This was the
reeking red splash on the map of all the world.</p>

<p>The soldiers leaped over Routledge and his captor.
Shielding his head from their boots and rifle-butts, the
American looked deep into the sweating brown faces
that rushed past—red, squinting eyes, upper lips twisted
with a fury they could not have explained, the snarling
muscles drawn tight—and not a zephyr of fear in the
command! Some of the men still had their eating-sticks
and bowls and paper napkins. One stuffed the contents
of a dish of rice into his mouth as he ran—an eight-pound
rifle clapped between his elbow and ribs.</p>

<p>The correspondent warmed to the human atoms
hurtling by and to the sergeant who stuck so fast to his
arm. There was something tremendous in the delusion
of these poor pawns who were doing their cruel work so
well. There was an infernal majesty in the huge gamble
for the old gray walls of Liaoyang on this gorgeous
morning.... War is immense and final—for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
big devil-clutched souls who make it—an achievement,
indeed, to gather and energize and hurl this great force
against an enemy, but what a rotten imposition upon the
poor little obscure men who <i>fight</i>, not a tithe the richer
if they take all Asia! So the thoughts of Routledge
surged. Into the havoc, from time to time, he threw a
sentence, wrung from the depths of his understanding:</p>

<p>“... Once a father threw his children out of
the sleigh to hold back a wolf-pack—as he whipped his
horse to the village. Would you call such a man
‘father’?... Yet you call a nation ‘fatherland’
that hurls you now to the wolves!... Oh, ye of
mighty faith!... Pawns—poor pawns—of plague,
famine, war around the world—God, tell us why the
many are consumed to ashes at the pleasure of the few!...
Oh, glorious Patriotism—what sins are committed
in thy name!”</p>

<p>The great system of Russian fortifications now opened
fire upon the Japanese charge. Men were falling. The
bulk of the infantry avalanche had passed, and smoke
was crowding out the distances. The long <i>p-n-n-n-g</i> of
the high bullets, and the instant <i>b-zrp</i> of the close ones,
were stimulus for that fast, clear thinking which so often
comes close to death. Routledge’s brain seemed to hold
itself aloof from his body, the better to grasp and synthesize
the startling actions of the present.</p>

<p>The smoke blurred all but a finger-bone of the
valley; yet from that part he could reconstruct the whole
horrid skeleton of a Twentieth-century crime....
The brown line of Japanese rolled up against the first
Russian trench. Routledge thought of toy soldiers,
heads bent forward, legs working, and guns of <i>papier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
maché</i> in bayonet charge. The works wore a white ruff
of smoke, and its lace was swept by stray winds down
over the fallen....</p>

<p>The grip upon his arm relaxed. For a moment Routledge
thought he was hit, when the blood rushed down
the veins of his arm where the tightened fingers had
been. He was free—and at what a cost! The little
sergeant was down—his legs wriggling and beating
against the American’s, the “red badge of courage”
widening on his breast. Routledge bent over him and
looked long into the dying face—forgetting the world
and the war, forgetting all but the spirit behind the hour.</p>

<p>The face was brown, oriental. In the corner of the
mouth was a flake of rice, and the coarse-grained dust
of Manchuria was over all. The eyes were turned back,
and the ears were bad. Evolution was young in the
shape of the head and the cut of those ears—small,
thick, close to the skull, criminal ears. But the mouth
was beautiful! It was carved as if some God had done
it—and on a fine morning when joy was abroad in the
world—and the perfection of the human mouth was
the theme of the day.</p>

<p>Routledge had not even water to give, but he said,
“Hello.”</p>

<p>Deep understanding came to him from the dying
face. He saw what it meant to this little soldier to
go out for his Emperor—saw the faith and pity of it all.
It was the smiling face of a man who comes home after
years of travail to the marvel of a loved woman’s arms.</p>

<p>“<i>Sayonara!</i>” the fine lips muttered. One of the
sweetest and saddest words of human speech—this
Japanese farewell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>“<i>Sayonara!</i>” Routledge repeated.... The body
jerked itself out, but the smile remained. The whole
story of the Japanese conquest stirred in Routledge’s
brain. It was all in the smile upon the face of the
guard—all in that one perishable portrait of joy.</p>

<p>Routledge had once seen the Emperor for whom this
soldier died with a smile. Though it was forenoon, he
had been forced to put on evening-clothes for the Presence.
Mutsuhito came back to his mind as he bent over
the fresh corpse....</p>

<p>“He has no such mouth as yours, little sergeant,” he
said in a swift, strange fashion. “His head is not so
good as your hard, bad head, though his ears are better.
He was dazed with champagne, as you have never been.
He had the look of an epileptic, and they had to bring
him a red-blooded woman of the people to get a son
from him—and that son a defective!... A soft,
inbred pulp of a man, without strength of will or hand or
brain, and God only knows what rudiment of a soul—such
is the Lord of Ten Thousand Years, whom you die
for with a smile. You are greater than the Empire you
serve, little sergeant—greater than the Emperor you die
for; since he is not even a clean abstraction....
God pity you—God pity you all!”</p>

<p>The sun sent streamers into the white smoke drapery
upon the Russian bank. The Island Empire men were
thrashing against it. They met with their breasts the
fire that spurted continuously from the ledges. One
man of a Japanese company lived to gain the top of the
trench. He was skewered on Russian bayonets and
shaken down among his writhing fellow-soldiers, as the
wing of a chicken is served upon a waiting plate. Running,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
crawling, Routledge made his way down and
forward.</p>

<p>The Japanese hope lives high above the loss of companies.
It was a glad morning for the Island Empire
men, a bright task they were given to do. Other companies,
full quota, were shot forward to tread upon the
dead and beat themselves to death against the entrenchment.
A third torrent was rolled against the Russians
before the second had suffered a complete blood-letting....
Routledge saw one five-foot demon wielding
his rifle-butt upon the rim of the trench, in the midst of
gray Russian giants. For an instant he was a human
tornado, filled with the idea to kill—that Brownie—then
he was sucked down and stilled. Routledge wondered
if they completely wiped out the little man’s smile at
the last.</p>

<p>He was ill from the butchery, and his mind was prone
to grope away from the bleeding heart of things; still,
he missed little of the great tragedy which unfolded in
the smoke. And always Oku, unparalleled profligate of
men, coiled up his companies and sprung them against a
position which Napoleon would have called impregnable—Oku,
whose voice was quiet as a mystic’s prayer. The
thought came to Routledge that the women of America
would tear down the capitol at Washington with their
hands, if the walls contained a monster who had spent
the blood of their sons and lovers as Oku was doing
now.</p>

<p>A new tumult in the air! It was like an instant
horrid crash of drums in the midst of a violin solo.
Artillery now roared down upon Oyama’s left wing....
The wildest dream of hell was on. Routledge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
crawling westward through the pit of fire, saw a platoon
of infantry smashed as a cue-ball shatters a fifteen block
in pool.... Westward under the Russian guns, he
crawled through the sun-shot, smoke-charged shambles,
miraculously continuing alive in that thick, steady, annihilating
blizzard of steel—his brain desperate with the
rush of images and the shock of sounds. Over a blood-wet
turf he crawled, among the quivering parts of
men....</p>

<p>Silence. Oku stopped to breathe and pick up the
fragments.... From far up on the Russian works—it
was like the celestial singing in the ears of the
dying—began a distant, thrilling music. Some regiment
or brigade, swinging into the intrenchments to relieve a
weary command, had burst into song.... Once
before Routledge had caught a touch of this enchantment,
during the Boxer Rebellion. He had never been
able to forget Jerry Cardinegh’s telling of the Russian
battle-hymns at Plevna.... Great emotions bowed
him now. Another terrace of defense caught up the
song, and the winds that cleared the reeking valley of
smoke carried along the vibrant inspiration. Every Russian
heart gripped the grand contagion. From terrace
to terrace, from trench to trench, from pit to emplacement,
that glorious thunder stalked, a company, a battery,
a brigade, at a stride. Each voice was a raw,
dust-bitten shout—the whole a majestic harmony, from
the cannon-meat of Liaoyang! Sons of the North, gray,
sodden, sorrow-stunted men of pent misery and unlit
souls—Finlander, Siberian, Caspian, Caucasian—hurling
forth their heart-hunger in a tumult of song that
shook the continent. The spirit of All the Russias giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
tongue—the tragedy of Poland, the clank of chains, the
mockery of palaces, the iron pressure of frost, the wail
of the wolf-pack on frozen tundras, the cry of the
crushed, the blind groping of the human to God—it
was all in that rhythmic roar, all the dreadful annals of
a decadent people.</p>

<p>As it was born, so it died,—that music,—from terrace
to terrace, the last wavering chant from out the city
walls. The little Japanese made no answer. Routledge
could not help but see the mark of the beast in contrast.
It wasn’t the Russians that bothered Oku, but the Russian
position. Kuroki would pull them out of that....
Song or steel, they would take Liaoyang. They
prepared to charge again.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the disorder of the next charge Routledge crossed
the railroad and passed out of the Japanese lines. Late
afternoon, as he hurried westward for his horses, he
met the eyes of Bingley. He was not given a chance to
pass another way. The race for the cable was on.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TWENTY-THIRD CHAPTER<br>

<small>ROUTLEDGE ENCOUNTERS THE “HORSE-KILLER” ON
THE FIELD OF LIAOYANG, AND THEY RACE
FOR THE UNCENSORED CABLE
AT SHANHAIKWAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> each man the intention of the other was clear as
the purpose of a fire-department’s run. One of them
would file the first uncensored story of the great battle.
Bingley had given up his chance to follow the Japanese
army, and had set his stony face to freedom for this
end—and England could not have horsed a man more
unwhippable. Routledge, striding into the sunset, toward
the place he had left his mounts, discovered with a smile
that his pace was quickening, quickening. The character
of the man just passed was an inspiration to rivalry.
Moreover, from a newspaper standpoint, the issue at
hand was big among dreams. The Great God, News, is
a marvellous master. Would England or America be
first to connect with Manchuria by wire? <i>World-News</i>
or <i>Thames</i>? If New York beat London, Dartmore would
trace the story.... Dartmore had been a savage.
Bingley had been a savage.</p>

<p>Routledge laughed aloud. He had long since put
away any resentment toward either of these men, but
there was vim, and glow, in getting into the struggle
again. He felt that he had earned his entry to this race.
He had counted upon taking the chances of discovery.
Already Bingley had seen him, and the word would go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
back; but the result of it would require time. He had long
planned to close his own campaign for the year, even if
the Japanese pushed on to Mukden. He would go
deeper, past following, into China—even to the Leper
Valley.</p>

<p>It was a momentous incident to Routledge—this
meeting with the “Horse-killer.” The quick, startled,
sullen look on the face of Bingley—not a flicker of a
smile, not even a scornful smile, to answer his own—had
meant that Cardinegh, dead or alive, had not told.</p>

<p>Bingley found the highway two miles west of the
railroad, and spurred south in the darkness at the rate
of about seven miles an hour. He meant to do six or
seven hours of this before resting his mount....
Between twelve and one in the morning—and at most
twenty miles to go! If there was anything left in his
horse, after an hour’s rest, so much the better. Otherwise
he could do it on foot, crossing the river above Fengmarong
by six in the morning. This would leave two hours
for the last two or three miles into Wangcheng. As for
the other, without a mount, Bingley did not concede it to
be within human possibility for him to reach the Chinese
Eastern at any point to-morrow morning. Evidently
Routledge had not planned to get away so soon. It
would take eighteen hours at least to reach Wangcheng
by the river, and Routledge, aiming westward, seemed
to have this route in view.... With all his conjecturing,
Bingley could find no peace of mind. Even
if Routledge had not planned to reach travelled-lines
to-morrow, would not the sight of a rival, with his speed
signals out and whistling for right of way, stir him to
competition? Such was his respect for the man who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
passed on, that Bingley could not find serenity in judging
the actions and acumen of Routledge by ordinary
weights and measures.</p>

<p>Any other British correspondent would have hailed
the outcast with the old welcome, notwithstanding the
race-challenge which his appearance involved. On the
morning he left Tokyo, five months before, Bingley had
also promised Miss Cardinegh to carry the news of her
father’s confession and death to Routledge, if he should
be the first to find him. It did not occur to Bingley now,
isolated as he had been so long, that this was the first
time Routledge had been seen. Moreover, in their last
meeting, at the Army and Navy ball, there had been a
brief but bitter passage of words. Bingley was not the
man to make an overture when there was a chance of its
being repelled. Finally, the sudden discovery of a
trained man, with carnage behind and the cable ahead,
was a juggernaut which crushed the life from every
other thought in his brain.</p>

<p>Routledge found his horses in excellent condition.
The Chinese whom he had brought from Pingyang had
proved faithful before, but with all the natives, not
alone the banditti and river-thieves, emboldened by the
war, the safe holding of his property was a joy indeed.
At seven in the evening, the sky black with gathering
storm, he left his servant, rich in <i>taels</i> and blessings,
and turned westward along the Taitse river-road. This
was neither the best nor the shortest way, but Routledge
preferred to be impeded by ruts, even by chasms, than
by Japanese sentries. With Bingley’s full panoply of
credentials it would have been different.</p>

<p>Sixty-five miles to ride, a river to cross, an audience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
with Consul Milner, a train to catch, to say nothing
of enforced delays by the possible interest of the Japanese
in his movements—all in fourteen hours.</p>

<p>As Bingley conjectured, the chance meeting had
hastened the plan of Routledge. He had intended to
reach Wangcheng the following day, but by no means
in time for the morning train; in fact, he had determined
to tarry at the American consulate until the decision
from the battle should come in. Wangcheng had
changed hands since his last call at the port, but he
counted on the wise and winning American to be as finely
appreciated by the Japanese as he had been by the Russians.
Milner would get the returns from the battle
almost as soon as the Japanese commander at the base.
The one word <i>victory</i> or <i>defeat</i>, and a line covering the
incidental strategic cause, was all that Routledge needed
for a startling story. He had mastered the field, and
Oku had supplied a rainbow of pigments.</p>

<p>Bingley, having left the field, would not loiter on
the road to the cable, nor would he halt before reaching
an uncensored cable—therefore Shanhaikwan to-morrow
night! Routledge did not care to accept second place,
if hard-riding would win first. He faced the longer
journey, and also set apart an hour before train-time
for an interview with the Consul. It was eminently plain
to him that this day had marked the crisis of the great
battle, even if it had not already ended with nightfall.
The unparalleled fury of Oku’s assaults was significant
to this effect. To-morrow would doubtless bring the
verdict; and all day to-morrow he would be on train to
Shanhaikwan, in touch with Milner by wire at every
station. Even if he reached the cable with the battle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
still raging, he could file the story of the great conflict,
as it was synthesized in one man’s brain—up to the point
of the historic last sentence.... Even as he rode,
the lines and sentences fused in his mind, a colorful,
dashing, galvanic conception that burned for expression.</p>

<p>On and on, hours and miles; cloud-bursts and flashes
of lightning to show the trail ahead—until he came to
doubt his watch, even the dawn of a new day, in the
pressure of the illusion formed of dragging hours and
darkened distances.</p>

<p>The rains helped to keep his mounts fresh. Every
two hours he changed. The beasts had been long
together, and either led with a slackened thong. He ran
them very little, and it was after midnight before he
dulled the fine edge of their fettle. They were tough,
low-geared Tartar beasts, heavy-breasted, short in the
pasterns, and quartered like hunters—built for rough
trails and rough wear. Routledge slapped and praised
them, riding light. It would take more than one gruelling
night under such a horseman to break their hearts.</p>

<p>Two hours after midnight the rain ceased, and the
wrung clouds parted for the moon. The hill country
was passed. Routledge moved swiftly along the river-flats.
It was the second night he had not slept, and his
fatigue was no trifle, but he was drilled to endure. It
was not in him to make a strongly reckonable matter out
of muscular stiffness and cuticle abrasions. True, rain
softens the glaze of a saddle, and long riding on the
sticky leather tears the limbs, but Routledge had a body
that would obey so long as consciousness lasted. He
used it that night.</p>

<p>Five-thirty in the morning; daylight; sixty miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
put behind. Ahead far in the new day he discerned the
Japanese outposts of Fengmarong; and on the right hand
was the big, mottled Liao, swollen with flood. If he were
to be detained by the Japanese, he preferred it to be on
the opposite bank—the Wangcheng side. Routledge rode
up to the ferry-scow and called for service. Yellow
babies were playing like cinnamon-cubs on the shore; two
women were cooking rice and fish; two men were asleep
in the sail-tackle. These he aroused. They helped him
with the horses, half-lifting the weary, trembling beasts
aboard. Cups of tea; rice with black dressing, as the
scow made the opposite landing at a forty-five degree
angle! A quick and safe crossing; and two hours for
the Japanese lines, the American Consul, and the Chinese
Eastern!... A distant call through the morning
light! Bingley, horseless, imperiously demands the
return of the craft to the Fengmorang bank.</p>

<p>Routledge had hoped to be missed by the other, at
least until train-time. He smiled at the compelling incidents
of the race thus far, and at the surpassing prospects—even
though he chilled at the thought that the Japanese
in Wangcheng would have big excuse to detain him if
Bingley intimated that his rival had once betrayed England
to the Russian spies on the Indian border. Consul
Milner would sweat, indeed, to free him against
that....</p>

<p>Yet Routledge had a feeling that he would win
against Bingley. Work had always favored him. So far
he had borne out the prophecy that he would not be
wounded in battle, in a manner past astonishment. It
was no less than a miracle—his escape from the firing
of both armies at Liaoyang. Often during the night-ride<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
he had thought of the wound that was to come to him—thought
with a chill of dread of the lawless country he
passed through. Now, with Wangcheng ahead, and
in touch with the safe-lines of foreign-travel—the
chance seemed minimized once more. There must be
significance in this.... He looked back and saw
the Chinese beating up against the river to the Fengmarong
landing, where Bingley waited, doubtless frothing
his curb.</p>

<p>At the edge of the town Routledge was arrested by
a five-foot Japanese sentry, and was locked with his
world tidings in a garrison, lately Russian, which overlooked
Wangcheng’s little square. He wrote “A. V.
Weed” on a slip of paper and asked to have it taken to
Consul Milner; then sat down by the barred window to
watch the Consulate across the Square. It was now seven
o’clock. The train left in an hour, and the station was a
mile away. Minutes dragged by.</p>

<p>An enlivening spectacle from the window. The
“Horse-killer” is being borne across the Square under
a Japanese guard! The little sentries at the edge of
town have been busy, this sweet-smelling morning after
the rain! Even at the distance, Routledge perceives that
the Englishman’s face is warmed with a lust for murder,
and he hears the Englishman’s voice demanding <i>his</i>
Consul. Bingley is borne into the garrison, and his
voice and step are heard throughout the halls. The
voice continues—as he is locked in the apartment next to
Routledge’s.</p>

<p>Fifteen dreadful minutes. Bingley is a noisy, unlovely
devil in the next room, beating against his bars.
Routledge remembers what Hans Breittmann said of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
caged orang-outang: “There is too much ego in his
cosmos.” The “Horse-killer” does not know that his
rival is so near—as he cries unto his heaven of martial
law, for artillery to shoot his way out of this town of
beastly, pig-headed Japanese coolies!... A Consul
appears in the Square. It is not the natty Milner, but
an elderly Briton, with a cane and a presence, who just
now asks to be shown to Mr. Bingley.... The
two talk softly for several minutes—a harsh interval for
Routledge.</p>

<p>“I shall do what I can as promptly as possible, Mr.
Bingley—trust me,” concludes the Consul, and his cane
sounds upon the flags once more—diminuendo.</p>

<p>“Remember, I must be on my way at once,” the
“Horse-killer” shouts after him.</p>

<p>Seven-twenty. Where was Milner?... Routledge
wondered bitterly if the Gods of War had turned
their faces from him at last. A low laugh from Bingley.
Milner was crossing the Square hastily, but did not
approach the garrison—instead was admitted to the big
building occupied by the Japanese headquarters.</p>

<p>“God, I’d hate to have to depend upon an American
Consul at a time like this,” is heard from the “Horse-killer.”</p>

<p>Routledge’s nerve was taxed to smile at this....
Seven-thirty. Consul Milner reappears in the Square,
this time followed by two Japanese officers of rank....
Routledge’s door is unlocked, and he is called
out into the hall.</p>

<p>“This is the gentleman—and I’ll vouch for him.”
Milner observes, holding out his hand to Routledge.
“Weed, my boy, how are you? Missed the train last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
night at Yopanga, I suppose, and came down the river.
Didn’t you know we’re a closed port down here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I knew <i>you</i> were here, Consul. The
battle’s on at Liaoyang, I understand.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the men managed to meet. The Japanese
officers bowed politely, and the two Americans left the
garrison.... Bingley’s voice is loudly upraised.
The Japanese officers politely inform him that the order
for his release has not yet reached them.</p>

<p>“Milner,” said Routledge, “would it complicate
matters if I fell upon your neck and wept?”</p>

<p>“Wait till we catch the train, Weed. That’s what
you want, isn’t it?” the Consul whispered.</p>

<p>“Badly.”</p>

<p>“So I concluded when I got the slip from you.
That’s why I went to headquarters to fix things before
coming here—saved a few minutes. Also I told my
Chino to get up the carriage. It’ll be ready....
Our British friend will have to get his business transacted
at once or he won’t get off for Shanhaikwan this
morning.... Great God, Weed, did you get the
battle—any of it?”</p>

<p>“I was with the left wing all day yesterday, Consul—it
seems like a month ago. Oku was beating his brains
out against the Russian intrenchments.”</p>

<p>They were crossing the Square. Bingley’s voice
reached them: “Oh, I say, American Consul, prod up
my man a bit—won’t you?”</p>

<p>The agonized face behind the bars took the edge off
his own success to Routledge. He knew what these
moments meant to the “Horse-killer.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, I’m not on speaking terms with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
British Consul,” Milner observed lightly to Routledge,
as they hurried to the carriage.</p>

<p>“I take it that Kuroki has crossed the Taitse—what
have you heard?” Routledge inquired quickly.</p>

<p>“Just that much,” Milner replied. “The Japanese
here say that Oyama will enter the city to-day. Kuroki
pontooned the river two days ago. What you saw was
the terrific effort of the Japanese to hold the bulk of the
Russian army in the city and below while Kuroki
flanked.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. I’m doing the story on those lines. I’ll
be in Shanhaikwan to-night. You’ll get the decision
to-day probably—wire me anywhere along the route,
Consul?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“The <i>World-News</i> will get you Tokyo for your next
post,” Routledge said with a laugh. “All I need is the
single sentence—‘Oyama wins’ or ‘Oyama loses.’
By the way, the Japanese have got two good horses of
mine——”</p>

<p>“I’ll see to them.”</p>

<p>The carriage reached the station at two minutes before
eight.</p>

<p>“It looks as if you had it all your own way, Weed,”
Milner observed with a laugh. “God! you’ve got the
world at your feet—the greatest newspaper chance in
years. You’ll give ’em a story that will rip up the
States. Show ’em pictures—never mind the featureless
skeleton—show ’em pictures, Weed!”</p>

<p>“I’ll try, Consul,” said Routledge, with feeling.</p>

<p>The station-boys were clanging their bells. The eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
of both men were fixed upon a clot of dust far down the
road.</p>

<p>“Weed, my boy,” said Milner excitedly, “the race
isn’t won yet. Your rival is going to make the train.”</p>

<p>The huge figure of the “Horse-killer” was sprinting
toward them, less than two hundred yards away.</p>

<p>“So I observe,” said Routledge. “You’ll have to
give me one more lift, Consul. A man who can run
like that will be rather hard to beat over the half-mile
course from the train to the cable-office in Shanhaikwan
at seven to-night. Wire Borden, the American Combined
Press man there, to arrange for me at the cable-office,
and to meet me when the train pulls in to-night, with the
fastest saddle-horse in Shanhaikwan—none but the fastest
will do. I’ll win the half-mile!”</p>

<p>The train was leaving the station. Bingley caught the
railing of the first-class coach, swung on, and staggered
by Routledge into the car. Milner signified with a final
gesture that he would look after the rights of America
and the <i>World-News</i>. Bingley, panting hoarsely, was
stretched out in his compartment when the American
entered. He did not look up, and no word passed
between them. For a moment Routledge hoped it might
be different—that day might bring to him something of
the life or death of Jerry Cardinegh. As the alleged
author of the Indian treachery, he could not bring himself
to seek the other’s notice. He wondered if Bingley
had used the crime charged against him, to hold him in
Wangcheng. This would have been natural; certainly
he had whispered to the British Consul in the garrison.
At all events, the swiftness of Milner’s efforts in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
behalf had killed the result of such an intent. Routledge
fell asleep. It was after ten when he awoke.</p>

<p>The “Horse-killer” was writing steadily, swiftly,
fighting sleep, his eyes cocked open like a stuffed bird’s,
and referring often to a carefully crowded note-book, the
like of which he had carried in India.... Routledge
started on his story. An hour’s sleep had quieted
his brain a trifle. Before, his thoughts had darted about,
like tumbler pigeons at play—in that queer light fashion
of extreme fatigue. With the structure placed, he began
to spend the great coiled chronicle at a swift, steady
pressure. For the first time in his life he turned loose all
that he had for a newspaper. The hurl of power glorified
him for the time—work’s chaste and lofty joy—until
he was beyond misery or any earthly evil. Without
thinking, he turned to Bingley at last:</p>

<p>“We both want the free cable at Shanhaikwan,” he
said briefly. “One of us will reach it first. It might
be well to arrange for the winner to turn over the wire—at
the end of, say, two hours—then both London and
New York would have the story in the morning.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the “Horse-killer” coldly. “I shall put
on whole story at once, and there will be five columns or
more of it.”</p>

<p>Routledge laughed inwardly, surprised at himself for
speaking, and just a little appalled at the grim nerve of
the other. In the great glow from his work, he had
followed a generous impulse to give Bingley and the
<i>Thames</i> a chance that night—on the basis of his meeting
a man at Shanhaikwan, with the best horse in the town.
In the emancipation of high expression, the sense of
rivalry had been lost, and he saw that Bingley was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
entitled to no little consideration, even if he were beaten
by a nose to the cable-door. Routledge went on with his
work, his compunctions eased.</p>

<p>At Koupangtze, the half-way station, there was a
stop for ten minutes. Bingley improved the time by close
conversation with an Englishman on the station platform.
Routledge, who remained in his compartment, wondered
with animation, as Bingley passed the other a sum of
money, if he were arranging with the Englishman to
telegraph for a horse to meet <i>him</i> at the train in Shanhaikwan.
Could there be two fastest horses at the end
of the run?</p>

<p>All that afternoon, as they crossed the brownest, most
level and ancient country on earth, two correspondents
toiled with words and a battle. At the little town of
Shenkau, Routledge heard the name of “Weed” called
in a laughable intonation by a Chinese boy on the platform.
He reached out and took the telegram. Milner
had not allowed a single sentence to suffice. Here is the
message:</p>

<p>The gods of war had been good to him, indeed. He
ran the telegram entire, at the head of his story. An
hour later the Great Wall appeared to his tired eyes.
His capacity to express or thrill at a thought was utterly
gone. Every film of the battle which his brain had
caught, all that he had desired to say, had been re-done
in pencil. He folded the sheets and put them away with
his credentials and cable-frank. The early twilight was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
soft and warm. The Great Wall cast a long shadow as
the train passed through its single break. The sea was
gilded and crimson-touched with the sunset. Shanhaikwan
station is but a half-mile from the Wall. Already
huts and burial-mounds were passed—dull brown in the
dusk.... They were in a free land now; the zone
of war and censorship lay behind. It was a dramatic
moment.</p>

<p>Each correspondent arose. Each correspondent
glanced at the heels of the other and found <i>spurs</i>!</p>

<p>Bingley made his way toward the rear-platform;
Routledge took the other. Leaning far out, as the train
pulled into the station, Routledge saw Borden and the
black stallion—hopped off and ran to him. A China-boy
holding the nervous, prick-eared mount stood beside
the Combined Press man. Routledge leaped into the
saddle. With the tail of his eye he saw Bingley rushing
along the platform toward a gray mount.</p>

<p>“They’re looking for you at the cable-office,” Borden
yelled. “Don’t burn out the wire!”</p>

<p>Half of Europe and a touch of Asia were represented
in the faces on the platform. Meeting the night-train
was the chief of the day’s social obligations in Shanhaikwan.
To-night everybody was down to get the last
fresh word from the field. The crowd sensed distantly
that rival correspondents had come in, and that a great
newspaper race was on, from the platform to the cable-office....
Spurring across the sandy station-yard,
the heart of Routledge lifted to the splendid spirit of the
game. He glanced around at the beating hoofs behind.
Bingley was straining forward in the saddle, furiously
rowelling his gray.... Above the cheering, Routledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
heard his name called, and the face of Talliaferro
appeared in the crowd, blurred as in a dream. Then came
a voice that incited all his senses.... He did not
see her. He thought it was in his soul.</p>

<p>“Routledge-san! Win—ride to win!” Then a trailing
“Routledge ... san!”</p>

<p>The Hate of London was not in the face of Talliaferro....
As he rode, the heavenly lifting of the moment
almost pulled him out of the race at hand....
“Win—ride to win!... Routledge-san!”...
He spurred. The black answered. Veritably, he was a
night-streak whirring cableward.... Routledge
knew every step of the way. The day would have been
lost, were he forced to halt for direction.... Past
the Rest House, through the mud-hut quarter, breaking
a detachment of Sikh infantry, he led the race—Bingley,
unable to gain, back in the shadows, shouting, rowelling!</p>

<p>There was some meaning to his words, but Routledge
did not think of them, until the gun-talk.... One
shot stood out by itself—and four followed....
The black sprawled.... Routledge found himself
coughing, but cleared grandly from the fallen mount, and
crossed the threshold of the cable-office. He realized that
he had fallen with the mount, but it made no impression.
His hands were bleeding. He met the dust full-length.
He knew that he staggered a bit as the operator leaped
over the counter and caught him in his arms....</p>

<p>“I’m Weed of the <i>World-News</i>.... Borden
arranged for me. Here’s the copy, credentials, cable-permit.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been waiting for you, Weed.... You’re
shot—my God!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>Bingley entered, his face terrible but frightened. He
glanced at the man who had beaten him—from head to
foot.... Routledge was leaning against the counter,
his clothing caked with dust, a laugh on his face,
dripping blood from a wound under his coat.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to hit you—I tried to get your horse!”
Bingley gasped.</p>

<p>“You did. Go out and finish him.... You’re
not much of a shot from the saddle—or perhaps you lost
your nerve, Bingley.... Any way, I am long
over-due for a wound.... Get a surgeon. I’m
hard-hit. Hurry!”</p>

<p>Routledge dropped forward on the counter, closing
his eyes. Bingley disappeared. The operator was unfastening
his clothes.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind me—until the doctor comes—but start
my stuff going.... By the way, in a couple of
hours, if it goes steadily, break in on my stuff and give
Bingley a head-line in the <i>Thames</i> to-morrow. He only
meant to get my horse—I see that. A man takes liberty
in shooting a horse from under another—but never mind.
There’s always room for two at the top!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“He was shot from behind—a bad wound, but not
necessarily a fatal one.... It hit him under the
right-shoulder-blade,” the doctor was saying.</p>

<p>Routledge felt choky and very tired. His consciousness
wavered back and forth like the throw of wind under
a punkah when the coolies are fresh.... There
was a light running step outside.... He was to
go down close to the Gates with a lock on his lips....
His lips were tightened. First of all, there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
a sweet breath of wind, like one of the best memories of
early life.... He wanted to rub his eyes, but the
surgeon held his hands.... Noreen’s voice was
quick and tragic. The word “die” was uttered.</p>

<p>“No,” the doctor repeated; “not necessarily a fatal
wound. I’ve ordered a carriage. We’ll take him to the
Rest House.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Noreen—the Leper Valley—the Russian music—the
Shanghai Bund—Charing Cross—the carriage—the hovel
in Rydamphur—the night in Bookstalls—Noreen—that
he must be silent in delirium—these were the waves of
consciousness.... He felt her hand, her lips, upon
his brow. Even if it were just a vision, he wanted to
welcome her with a smile, but his lips were locked.</p>

<p>“Oh, you martyr—you blessed martyr!...
Don’t you know me, Routledge-san?”</p>

<p>“Is it true, Noreen? Are you here?”</p>

<p>“With you always, beloved.”</p>

<p>A frown fell upon his face. “I just came in from
Liaoyang for the cable. It isn’t good for you to be with
me.”</p>

<p>“My Master—don’t you know Father is dead, and
that he was sane to confess at the last?... Feeney
and Finacune were there.”</p>

<p>The eyes of Routledge found her.</p>

<p>“Just a minute, doctor,—I must say this....
Noreen, don’t speak of it again—the others need not
know! Your father was the best and bravest of our
breed——”</p>

<p>“Strongheart!... London knows; Tokyo
knows; every British correspondent cabled it to his paper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
that night, months ago; there are crowns of vine-leaves
for you in the heart of every friend of yours; the Secret
Service knows——”</p>

<p>“But your good name, Noreen——” he faltered.</p>

<p>“My name is Routledge for eternity,” she answered,
and the famous eyes bent to lull him.... “Sleep,
my lover, sleep.... I shall always be with you
now!”</p>

<small>THE GREAT FRIEZE COAT AND THE WOMAN JOURNEY
DOWN THE COAST OF CHINA TOGETHER,
AND CROSS INDIA TO THE LEPER VALLEY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> one hurried a destroyer after this torpedo of a
man, the “Horse-killer.” Now and then a Bingley
bullet, when it is not aimed too accurately, gives a tired
man a rest which his energy would not permit by any
less drastic measure. Certain heroic temperaments must
needs receive a jolt every little while to force them to
lie down.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of men in the world—those who
have a sense of brotherhood, and those whose every
thought is an explosion designed to increase their own
personal impetus. The one makes war; the other peace.
Perhaps the ultimate relation between the two is suggested
in the race for the cable—and its result.</p>

<p>Routledge healed in a month, and incidentally found
his first rest in years. Noreen was with him—a tremendous
thing. The two had been long apart, pent and
hungering.... Meanwhile, the world read and
commented upon the great story of Liaoyang. Bingley’s
story led in London.</p>

<p>On their last day in Shanhaikwan, they walked along
the Wall—Routledge and Noreen—and that night were
together in the Yellow Sea. The ship was the <i>Tung
Shing</i>, a little steamer that breasted the waves in her
own way, but quite correctly. So clean and clever was
she, that everyone was refreshed. There were no distractions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
nor counter-attractions, and every night-view
was beautiful. The loom of the Wu Tung light was over
the shoulder of the East, and a cliff to avoid on the starboard.
A rising wind decided not to bother, and boomed
away north, before the near sea was aroused to a fit of
temper.</p>

<p>Routledge was so happy that he did not care for utterance.
Noreen drank the chill breeze in silence for a
long time. Once she placed her hand upon the sleeve
of the great frieze coat.... Thus they sailed down
the variegated and populous coast of China—a different
breath from every big and little harbor. Noreen caught
them all and was glad, divining far at sea the places she
had tarried, but Routledge was Asia and countless continents
to her. One night when only the pilot and the
ship-lights and themselves were burning, the thought
came to embrace—but they refrained.</p>

<p>Presently they were down to Singapore; then across
to Calcutta, where the Ganges opens her mighty throats
to the sea; then up by devious travels—to catch the
breath of the Hills after the Heats. Morning and nightfall,
Routledge looked down into Noreen’s eyes and
found his world. Night-winds of India soothed them,
though apart. And they had their thoughts of the day’s
travel together.</p>

<p>At length, up over the crest of the world in their
wanderings, they looked, from the amethyst Himalayas,
down upon that strange dead civilization of China, a
vista for eagles. Tight in the heart of it was the Leper
Valley.</p>

<p>This is reached by one of the lost trails of the world.
A few gallant explorers have picked the way, but failed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
to publish since the people would think such a report a
fiction, and their reputations for veracity be broken.
Traders pass the rim of the gap regularly, but do not
know it.</p>

<p>Routledge had learned it from a Sannyasi. The way
is tortuous and a bit perilous, so he arranged for Noreen
and himself to follow a party of traders. Among these
men was a Boy. There was cleanness in his gray eye,
and you could not think of taint and look at his cheeks
so ruddy under the tan. The Boy searched Noreen’s
face with the guilelessness of a child and the valor of a
man. When he rode beside her, the air that she breathed
was new.</p>

<p>Of course the saddle was torture to her, a cumulative
torture with the hours, but it was only physical, and
night bore down with the sleep of healing, from the
twilight of evening to the twilight of dawn. The journey
melted into a strange composite of cool mountain winds;
brief, warm showers which released the fragrance of the
valleys; humans in dim doors and upon the highways,
held, as they passed, in tableaux of freezing horror—suffering,
sunlight, sleep. And always ancient China
unfolded greater vistas of hills, fields, huts, and glowering
yellow faces; and always the Boy walked beside and
served—a ragged chaperon.</p>

<p>Routledge would smile on his way and note the large
relation. The traders, too, were respectful—brave men
whom the Open had kept mainly pure. There is a curse
upon a white man in Asia, if he relaxes.</p>

<p>Once the Boy said: “Don’t be afraid, lady. This
is the sleepiest part of China. Any way, I would take
care of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>Routledge bent over from his mount and patted the
Boy’s shoulder.</p>

<p>They parted by the wayside with a smile—the Boy
and Noreen. She proffered him her purse, but he
answered:</p>

<p>“I don’t want that. But any time I can help you—hail
out! What are you going to do—stopping off
here?”</p>

<p>She threw a kiss to him, but did not answer. The
traders were far ahead, and the Boy turned his back.</p>

<p>“The world has gone,” Noreen said, after they had
walked long through a tangled way. “Look below.”</p>

<p>“Yes—the Leper Valley—our bravest man!”</p>

<p>It was mid-afternoon. Routledge paused at the verge
of a steep declivity, and they saw a radiant hollow evenly
rimmed by mountains on every side. A lake gleamed at
the bottom of this finger-bowl of the Gods, and moist
tropical perfumes were borne softly upward with a far
sound of bells—faint as the tinkle of drops of water falling
upon thin metal.</p>

<p>And together they went down into the fragrance.
Noreen could feel her heart; she could feel her soul; and
too there was an enchanting beauty in this delve of the
world. It sustained. It was so wonderful—like a child
laughing alone in paradise! There was a sound of
chimes in the vast silence, and God seemed to speak
above.</p>

<p>The thatches below were trimmed and even. There
were spaces between them, and from the heights these
spaces had the clean look of a brown polished floor.
There was depth and purity in the green of the lake, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
the little temple, in the midst of its gardens, was white
as Truth.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>They were in a swept and shaded village. The
woman was walking swiftly, her lips parted, her eyes
feverishly bright. Routledge laughed quietly at her ardor
to see the man whom his heart knew to be there and
always waiting. The huts seemed deserted, except for
those <i>who could not leave</i>.</p>

<p>A voice reached them at last—the voice that had
echoed through the inner consciousness of each so long....
His back was toward them. The people upon
the earth before him, they did not see—save as factors of
the scene. Swiftly they moved forward now.</p>

<p>Rawder’s hand was raised in the sunlight. It was
slender, nervously responsive to his emotion—but whole,
<i>whole</i>! A little way off they halted, inspired by a
glimpse of his profile.... It was the face of the man
who had climbed to the roof of the world, lived through
ice and flame; it was sun-darkened, storm-bitten, gaunt
from suffering under the irons of self-repression, mystical
in its manifestation of a cosmos within. It was the face
of an exile who has felt the hate of man, the absence of
women, and the Presence of God. And it was whole,
<i>whole</i>.</p>

<p>He turned suddenly and saw the two standing together.
There was something beautiful in his bewilderment,
and in the expression of sadness which followed—since
this was to be his last meeting with Routledge.
A gesture, and the lowly ones were dismissed; and when
the temple-court was empty, save for the Three—they
joined hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>Whispering, he led them into the temple gardens at
the edge of the lake. The water was glorified in the
sunset, and by the stones of his doorway the drowsy lilies
drank the last rays. Magicians of ancient and wondrous
patience had conserved the verdure and mastered the
flowerings. There were none but flawless leaves and
none but classic blooms. The pebbles on the shore had
been touched into mosaics, and the vines which fixed the
coolness in the stones of his dwelling had seemingly
been guided into perfection by fingers in the night. Out
of love his people served him; out of love they had
charmed a fountain from the ground near his doorway;
placed sounding-shells to lure music from the dropping
water, and forced Emperor roses lavishly to arise and
shelter and perfume his bathing-place.</p>

<p>“All these things my people have done for me,
blessed friends,” Rawder said, “and all I asked when I
came was to share a hut with the least of them.”</p>

<p>At the arbored doorway, he stepped aside and bowed
their entrance. Far within a figure moved to and fro
without a sound.</p>

<p>The perfection of the little home in the gardens of
the temple was like singing in the hearts of the lovers....
As they entered, the Name, marvellously intoned,
reached them from the figure which had moved but a
moment before, but they could not see clearly in the dim
twilight. When the candles were brought, Routledge
found that it was Sekar, the Hindu Master. So ancient
and withered was he, that his sitting erect on a mat of
<i>kusa</i> grass seemed a miracle.</p>

<p>Rawder served them with food and drink; and afterward,
outside, the Three talked long at the edge of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
fountain. Always, from within, they heard the ineffable
syllable, OM, at intervals, like a distant sound of the sea
on a rocky beach. From the huts of the afflicted there
was steady silence.</p>

<p>At last the meditation was broken, and they heard
quaveringly from Sekar within these words in Tibetan.
Rawder translated hastily:</p>

<p>“My son, my <i>chela</i>!... To-morrow we arise
and ascend the goodly mountains to our Long Home.
We are very weary, and I have seen that our work is
finished here.”</p>

<p>The Three entered. Sekar beheld them. After a
moment, Sekar spoke:</p>

<p>“And this is the friend of my <i>chela</i>; and this, the
woman?”</p>

<p>Rawder bowed.</p>

<p>“To-morrow, in the first light,” the Hindu said fervently,
“my <i>chela</i> and I depart for the Hills where the
Snows are—where none may follow. And you, man
and woman, go back to the world.”</p>

<p>Noreen turned a quick glance from Routledge to
Rawder. “Ask him,” she said swiftly to the latter, “if
there is not a great work for us to do here in the Leper
Valley!”</p>

<p>The face of the bravest man was frightened, ghastly,
as he interpreted. The eyes of Routledge were fixed
upon the woman as never before.</p>

<p>“No,” the Hindu said. “We have left our disciples
here among the Chinese. The Valley will be sweetened
by them. You, man and woman, have a greater work in
the world, as my <i>chela</i> and I have a greater work—far
above the world!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>Deep into the night the Three listened to the music
of the fountain, in the pure ardor of the lilies; and there
was a moment in which Rawder wept.... In the
full light of morning, the Four were at the parting of
their ways.</p>

<p>“Remember,” said the bravest man, “always, to you
both, whom I have had the joy to make One, goes out
constantly—the dearest of my heart—from the Hills or
from the Stars!”</p>

<p>Routledge and Noreen watched, as he helped his
Master—until the two were lost in the winding, rising
trail. Then they looked down, a last time, upon the
silence and sunrise which brooded upon the Leper
Valley.</p>
